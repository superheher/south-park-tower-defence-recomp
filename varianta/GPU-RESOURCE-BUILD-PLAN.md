# Variant A — GPU-Resource Subsystem: build plan (cont.23, 2026-06-05)

The authoritative, current plan for the remaining deep build. **Supersedes** the cont.13–19
producer/consumer framing in `RENDERER-DESIGN.md` (cont.21 measured that producer/consumer is
per-submission *bookkeeping*, NOT the per-draw path; the real draws are PM4 `DRAW_INDX` in kicked
IBs / the deferred device+13568 segments). Consolidates the cont.21–23 measurements into an
actionable design so a focused implementation session can start cleanly.

## Goal
Get variant A to render the **real, textured** menu. This is gated on a GPU-resource subsystem:
the title's resource loader must produce **non-null, real GPU resources** so it completes → the
title advances to a populated menu state → builds real content → which a real renderer draws.

## The wall — two-sided, exhaustively measured (cont.23)
- **Rendering side:** the geometry render path is PROVEN — the backdrop (4 EDRAM-tile quadrants),
  2 nested dialog panels, and a real 63-glyph text label all render via the debug menu-quad
  pipeline (`REX_EXECSEGS`/`REX_VBFILL`/`REX_UITEXT`, this session). BUT **every UI texture is
  empty**: the static font atlas `0xA5004800` AND the EDRAM backdrop `0xB0000000` both read all
  zeros (`[scene-tex]`/`[atlas]`). Nothing textured can draw — there is no texture data.
- **Loader side:** `child[0]` (`0x82657578`) is the **sole sequential blocker** — at the loader's
  active poll it is state 2 (processing) while children[1..19] are state 0 (not started); they
  queue behind it (`[children]` survey). child[0] cycles 2→3→6→8→10 producing a **null resource**,
  and `sub_8224F918` (driven from frontend `sub_8214FFD0`) re-queues it forever.
- **Root (both sides agree):** child[0]'s **GPU resource-create** is inlined XDK-D3D that submits
  create-PM4 + waits on a GPU completion variant A's present-only CP never produces. cont.22
  PROVED **no shortcut exists**: force-state (`REX_POLLFORCE`), latch-at-done, and fence-forward
  all fail — the title *uses* the real resource downstream, so a fake/null one breaks later.

## What variant A HAS vs LACKS
**HAS (leverage these):**
- `ExecutePM4` — the PM4 interpreter (type-0/1/2/3 packets, SET_CONSTANT→reg file `0x7FC80000+reg*4`,
  DRAW_INDX, INTERRUPT, EVENT_WRITE, fences). The natural home for resource-create modeling.
- `REX_CPCOMPLETE` — faithful per-vblank drain of the pending-counter `device+0x2b04` (cont.21).
- `REX_EXECSEGS` — executes the deferred `device+13568` segment directory each swap (the content
  the title builds but never kicks); the `DRAW_INDX` carve + the menu-quad bridge already render
  its geometry.
- A debug **menu-quad VkPipeline** (float2 pos + push-const {mat4 mvp, vec4 color}, alpha blend) +
  `rex_render::SubmitMenuGeometry` bridge + the present path (movie YUV blit already works).
- Relocated dispatch table (host mmap, `HostFnAt`) — the string-as-code crash class is fixed.
- A stable full-menu run base: `REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`.

**LACKS (the build):** a real Xenos→Vulkan renderer — **no** tiled-texture decode, **no** `.xbv`→
SPIR-V shader translation, **no** EDRAM render-targets/resolves, **no** real draw-state→VkPipeline
translation (the menu-quad path is debug-only: position+flat-color, no textures/UVs/real formats).

## The pieces to build (in `ExecutePM4` / the CP)
1. **Resource-create completion model** — when the loader's child[0] submits its create stream,
   EXECUTE it for real: model the upload (DMA/`MEMORY` writes into the resource's backing) and
   signal the exact completion the loader waits on (its fence/event), so the state machine reaches
   done *with real backing*. ⚠ DECISIVE OPEN QUESTION (test first, see below): does the loader need
   only the upload-fence + valid resource *memory*, or the fully-created GPU object (compiled
   shader / decoded texture)? If the former, this piece alone may unblock the loader cheaply.
2. **Xenos tiled-texture decode** — fetch-constant (reg `0x4800+slot*6`, format/dims/tiled fields,
   already decoded in `REX_DRAWLOG`) → untile → `VkImage` + sampler. Needed for the font atlas,
   sprites, and backdrop sampling. Ref: Xenia `texture_conversion` / `texture_info`.
3. **`.xbv` → SPIR-V shader translation** — child[0] loads `Simple.xbv` (612 B, a shader). The
   `.xbv`/`.updb` carry original **D3D9 `vs_3_0`/HLSL** (cont.22: version token `FF FE 03 00`, a
   `$worldviewProj` constant). 19 `.updb` HLSL sources exist → compile to SPIR-V (no microcode
   translator needed). Ref: the HLE-spike "Plume" path + the 19 `.updb`.
4. **EDRAM render-targets + resolves** — the backdrop samples EDRAM (`0xB0000000`); the title
   renders the background art to EDRAM then blits it. Model render-to-EDRAM-target + resolve→texture.
5. **Real draw-state → VkPipeline + vkCmdDraw** — replace the debug menu-quad carve: per draw,
   build the pipeline from reg-file 0x4000 ALU consts (the transform — already extracted as World+
   screen-ortho Proj) + 0x4800 fetch consts (verts + textures) + RB surface/blend/viewport state +
   the translated shaders, and `vkCmdDraw`. The vert/transform plumbing is already proven
   (`REX_UITEXT` count-correlation, the backdrop carve).

## Recommended build order (front-load the loader-unblock; defer the heavy renderer)
- **STEP 0 — decisive test (cheap, do first):** model child[0]'s create-PM4 **upload + completion
  fence** (piece 1, minimal: real backing memory + signal the fence), WITHOUT decode/compile. Run
  and watch the `[children]` survey + the transition: does child[0] reach done *and stay* (not
  re-queued), and do children[1..19] start? **If yes** → the loader needs only real backing+fence,
  and the title will progress to a populated menu (then build pieces 2–5 to render it). **If no**
  (still re-queued) → the loader needs the fully-created GPU object → pieces 2/3 are prerequisites
  to the unblock (heavier path). This test decides the whole build's shape — run it before
  committing to the heavy pieces.
- **STEP 1:** whichever the test dictates — either (a) finish the lightweight completion model and
  let the title progress, or (b) build texture-decode (piece 2) + shader-translation (piece 3)
  enough to make child[0]'s specific resource real, then complete.
- **STEP 2:** with the title progressing + building real content, build the real draw translation
  (piece 5) + the textures (piece 2) → render the populated menu. EDRAM targets (piece 4) for the
  background art.
- Each step is committable + render-verifiable (PPM capture) and must keep default boot unregressed.

## Entry points / known facts (addresses)
- **Loader:** state machine `sub_82248010` (ppc_recomp.29); parent obj `0x826574E8`, children at
  `0x82657578 + i*216` (state @+136, ready-flag @+208); pump call at guest lr `0x82248224`
  (`REX_POLLDIAG`); re-queue `sub_8224F918`←frontend `sub_8214FFD0` (ppc_recomp.30); done = state
  1/12; `*(child+208)`=ready (=1 in prod). child[0] reaches its states but produces a null resource.
- **Resource:** child[0] loads a file via `sub_822485A0` (returns size; 612=`Simple.xbv`). The
  create is inlined XDK-D3D in the frontend — no clean guest-function hook (HLE-spike + cont.22).
- **Create completion:** the title waits on a GPU fence (cont.22: `device+10896` / the segment
  pointer) + the pending-counter `device+0x2b04` (drained by `REX_CPCOMPLETE`).
- **Content:** built into `device+13568` (segment directory, `{0x81LLLLLL, phys}` descriptors;
  guest = `0xA0000000|(phys&0x1FFFFFFF)`); executed by `REX_EXECSEGS`. Per frame the menu state is
  SPARSE (~7-8 draws: 4 backdrop quadrants + 1 on-screen prim-4 quad + off-screen sprite/text) —
  richer content appears only after the loader completes + the title advances.
- **VB binding (UI draws):** the per-draw vertex binding is stubbed — the UI VS reads fetch slot-0
  = empty `0xA2000000`; the real verts are written by `sub_821F8E60` (D3D dynamic-VB Lock
  [vtable+120=`sub_822052B0`→alloc `sub_821C48B0`→`0xA022FFF0`] / fill `sub_8242BF10` / Unlock
  [vtable+124=`sub_822052F8`, device bookkeeping]) but the SetStreamSource that binds it is never
  emitted into the segment ([esset]/[esset2]=0). A real renderer must bind the VB the draw's
  dynamic buffer (count-correlation, `REX_UITEXT`, is a working stand-in for that mapping).

## Risks / open questions
- **STEP 0's answer** is the biggest unknown — it determines whether the loader-unblock is cheap
  (fence+backing) or requires the heavy GPU-object creation. Resolve it first.
- **No clean hook** for the inlined create ⇒ the build must intercept at the **PM4 level**
  (ExecutePM4), reading the create stream the title submits, not overriding a guest create function.
- **Scope:** the full renderer (pieces 2–5) is large (Xenia-scale). The reachable menu state is
  simple (background + a few buttons), which bounds it somewhat — but EDRAM/texture/shader are each
  substantial. This is a sustained, multi-session build with no quick visible payoff (cont.22's
  "poor /loop fit" — confirmed). A debug prod-oracle build (`-g`/DWARF) would unblock cross-checks
  (prod currently has no DWARF — `readelf -S` shows only `.symtab`).
- **Alternative to weigh:** the whole variant-A renderer exists to escape the prod CP-translation
  perf floor; building it is large. Worth a deliberate go/no-go vs. other floor approaches before
  committing the multi-session effort.

## ⭐ ALTERNATIVE PATH (cont.23, more tractable) — bypass the stuck loader via DISK resources
The deep loader fix (inlined-D3D resource-create, no hook) is the hard wall. But **the game ships
all the resources on disk** (`private/extracted/media/`), so the renderer can load them DIRECTLY
instead of waiting for the loader:
- **PS shaders:** `media/shaders/*.updb` (19, all `ps_3_0`) are **XML with the ORIGINAL HLSL
  source** inline (e.g. `Simple.psh` = `tex2D(diffuseTexture, In.Tex) * In.Color`). Extract the
  HLSL → compile to SPIR-V via the project's existing `shaderc` (already used for the menu-quad
  shaders). Names map to materials: `SPBackdropTextured/Untextured` (background), `SPTextured/
  Untextured` (sprites), `SPHud*` (HUD), `SpMovie`, `Simple` (textured sprite). The matching `.xbv`
  (612 B for Simple) is the compiled microcode the title loads — match a draw's IM_LOAD'd PS
  microcode bytes to a `.xbv` file → use that `.updb`'s HLSL.
- **VS:** NOT in the `.updb` set (all PS). Write a small transform VS — the transform is already
  measured (reg 0x4000 = World-translate c0/c1 + screen-ortho Proj c4/c5), input = pos.xy + uv.xy
  (+ color), output = clip + uv + color. (The title's real VS is generated/shared, or in the PM4
  IM_LOAD microcode; a hand-written transform VS suffices for these flat 2D draws.)
- **Textures:** 659 `.png` under `media/Assets/{Frontend,hud,Global,Fonts,...}` (the runtime `.xmc`
  are the tiled versions of the same art). Decode a `.png` → RGBA → VkImage. Map by draw: backdrop
  draws → the backdrop art `.png`; sprite/atlas draws → the UI/font atlas `.png`.

**Build order (this path):** (1) a textured VkPipeline in vulkan_render.cpp — input pos.xy+uv (+
color), sampler2D, FS = the `Simple` HLSL (tex2D×color), alpha-blended; (2) load ONE `.png` → VkImage
+ a `SubmitTexturedGeometry(clipXY, uv, texId)` bridge (extend the menu-quad path, which already
carries the verts/UVs via `REX_UITEXT` snapshots — UVs are captured but currently unused); (3)
texture the existing geometry (backdrop quadrants → backdrop png; text glyph-quads → font atlas).
**⚠ Honest limits:** this textures the SPARSE content the stuck title builds (backdrop + a few
sprites + the one text label) — a *textured* version of the current sparse menu, NOT the rich menu
(which still needs the loader to progress the title). But it's far more tractable than the loader
build, produces a real textured result, and reuses the proven geometry path. **⚠ Risks:** the
draw→png mapping (heuristic; match by shader name / texture address); whether the `.png` art aligns
with the title's UVs (likely — `.png` is the source of the `.xmc`); the backdrop samples EDRAM
(`0xB0000000`, a render-to-texture composition, not one png) so its art may need the actual
background `.png` chosen by name, not the EDRAM contents.

# cont.25 — RENDERER WALL: complete scene characterization + build sequencing (2026-06-05)

User chose "start the renderer build". The `REX_SCENE` survey of the per-frame executed menu scene
(`REX_EXECSEGS=3`) gives the authoritative target. **Per frame ~7-8 draws, ALL texture sources empty:**

| draw | prim | numI | World pos | on-screen? | texture |
|------|------|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| sprite | 5 | 4 | (-253,-226) | **off** | `tex=0x0` (none bound) |
| tri-list | 4 | 6 | (64,36) | **ON** | `tex=0x0` |
| text | 13 | 252 | (334,866) | **off** | `tex=0x0` |
| backdrop ×4 | 8 | 3 | (334,866) | off | `tex=0xB0000000` EDRAM **1×1 zeros** |

Font atlas `0xA5004800`/`0xA5004000` = all zeros. ⇒ **THREE distinct stubbed texture-create paths**, none work:

1. **Sprite/UI textures (`tex=0x0`)** — the title binds a NULL texture handle: the inlined-XDK-D3D texture-
   create (decode a loaded file e.g. `global.bin`/`.xmc` → guest texture mem + a Xenos fetch constant) is
   stubbed. *Keystone for the rich menu.* Build: find the create (it consumes the loader's read bytes — NOT in
   the loader state machine sub_82248010, which is pure file I/O; it's in the D3D asset-upload path), model it:
   allocate guest texture mem, untile/copy the source, write the fetch constant (reg 0x4800+slot*6) so SetTexture
   binds real data; then the executed draw's fetch constant is non-null → REX_SCENE shows `tex=0x05xxxxxx`.
2. **Backdrop (EDRAM `0xB0000000`)** — a render-to-EDRAM-target + resolve→texture that never ran (piece 4).
   cont.24 SIDESTEPPED this with a disk `.png` (LevelSelectBG) — "done" heuristically; real EDRAM RT is its own
   piece, lower priority (the disk stand-in works).
3. **Font atlas (`0xA5004800`)** — TTF rasterization (fonts loaded vbc26: southpark/ariblk/Comic.ttf) never
   populated it. Either the raster uses a stubbed import, or it's gated like the textures. Readable text needs
   this populated AT THE TITLE'S atlas layout (the prim-13 UVs index it — a host-rasterized atlas won't match
   unless the layout is replicated). Medium; the glyph→UV mapping is the sub-keystone.

**⚠ NO INCREMENTAL VISIBLE PAYOFF (honest):** the scene is mostly OFF-SCREEN (a pre-menu/loading state, only
the prim-4 at (64,36) on-screen). Elements position on-screen + menu art loads only when the title ADVANCES,
which (cont.21 A↔B) needs REAL rendered results. So texturing the current draws alone won't show a "rich menu";
the title must advance too. This REINFORCES cont.22-24's "massive sustained build, poor /loop fit" — now with a
corrected target (renderer, not loader). Each of the 3 paths is multi-step; the rich menu needs ≥1 + the advance.

**Recommended sequencing (de-risk the keystone first):**
- **R0 (keystone investigation): ANSWERED (cont.25, `REX_TEXWATCH`).** GPU texture MEMORY *is* allocated —
  `MmAllocatePhysicalMemoryEx` (g_physNext from 0xA0000000) makes 442 blocks incl. texture-sized ones (5×
  `sz=0xE1000`≈924KB, 11× `0x44000`≈272KB) in the 0xA4–0xA5xxxxxx range where the atlas (0xA5004800) lives.
  Flagged the first 924KB block and (a) gdb hardware-watchpointed its first dword over ~85s = **never written**,
  (b) headless-sampled it 3 offsets (0 / 64KB / 900KB) over the run = **offset 0 gets a tiny header (`0x01000000`)
  but the BULK (64KB, 900KB) stays ZERO**. The atlas stays zero too. ⇒ **the texture create ALLOCATES + writes a
  struct header, but the DATA POPULATE (decode/upload of the loaded file into the allocated pixels) DOES NOT
  EXECUTE.** Not "model the upload" (no upload happens at all) — it's "the populate path is never reached/run."
  **R0 DEFINITIVE (REX_TEXWATCH +[texread] filename trace):** big asset reads split cleanly by destination —
  **audio** (`MainWaveBank.xwb` 22MB, `MainSoundBank*.xsb`) is read DIRECTLY into the physical/GPU window
  (0xA0000000+, works), but **every texture/UI file** (`UI.xzp` 23MB, `lipsynctextures.bin`, fonts, the movie)
  is read into **SYSTEM memory**. NO texture file is ever read into a GPU texture block. ⇒ the missing step is
  the **decode + upload (system-mem texture data → the allocated guest GPU texture mem, with Xenos untiling) +
  the fetch-constant setup** — it simply never runs. That is THE keystone, isolated. Two sub-questions left for
  R1: is that upload (a) a stubbed/no-op inlined-D3D path that just needs implementing (decode+copy+fetch-const),
  or (b) gated behind the A↔B GPU-completion (deferred until the title sees real results)? The font atlas
  (0xA5004800) is a SEPARATE path (TTF raster of the loaded `.ttf` — also never runs). R1 starts by implementing
  the decode+upload for ONE texture (the format is in the Xenos fetch-constant; ref Xenia texture_conversion) and
  wiring SetTexture's fetch constant, then checking whether the title-advance still gates the visible draw.
- **R1:** model the create for ONE texture → REX_SCENE shows a non-null `tex=` for a sprite draw → wire the
  executed draw to sample it via the existing textured pipeline (g_texPipe + UploadTexture from cont.24, which
  already decode-and-sample a guest RGBA buffer). First real textured UI draw.
- **R2:** generalize (texture decode for the Xenos tiled formats — ref Xenia texture_conversion), then the font
  atlas + the title-advance (A↔B) for the positioned menu.
- Each step committable + REX_SCENE-verifiable; keep default boot unregressed.
