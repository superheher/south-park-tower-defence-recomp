# Variant A — Autonomous Night Session Log

Branch `experimental/hle-graphics-spike` · started **2026-05-31 22:31 MSK** · user asleep → fully autonomous.
Driver: `docs/NEXT-SESSION-VARIANTA-PROMPT.md`. **NEVER push.** Commit each increment as `superheher`.

## Baseline (verified at start)
- HEAD `925b657` on `86dfa35`. Toolchain clone `rexglue-recomps/third_party/XenonRecomp` @ `ddd128b`
  (upstream hedge-dev), with my **124-line `recompiler.cpp` diff == committed
  `varianta/patches/xenonrecomp-sp-instructions.patch`** (verified byte-identical). Binaries built.
- Unrecognized instructions = **10,960** (18 instructions implemented so far).
- Pre-existing dirty files in repo (`tools/perf/*.sh`, `tools/perf/detdiff/cand_*.json`) are NOT mine —
  keep every commit scoped to `varianta/` only.

## Guardrails (active)
- Do NOT touch `third_party/rexglue-sdk` or game-dir `librexruntime.so` (baseline `1a3f6076`).
- Do NOT bump the superproject `main` submodule pointer. Do NOT re-open variant B / Xenia CP opts.
- Do NOT run the game during TASK 1–3. Regenerate the patch after every `recompiler.cpp` change.

## Progress
- **[22:31]** Oriented; clone diff == committed patch (byte-identical). Started background rebuild of
  `XenonRecomp` to re-confirm the 10,960 baseline; reading `recompiler.cpp` to map emitter patterns.
- **[22:45]** Mapped emitter conventions. Key findings: (1) the full-vector byte-reversal on load
  *preserves each element's value* and merely relabels lane `i ↔ N-1-i` ⇒ per-lane symmetric ops
  (add/sub/shift/min/max/avg/compare) are reversal-agnostic (use the matching simde intrinsic or scalar
  loop, like existing `VSLW`/`VADDSHS`). (2) `setFromMask` is movemask-based: `imm=0xFFFF` for
  byte+halfword compares (each true halfword = 2 set bits), `0xF` via the `simde__m128`/float overload
  for word compares. (3) CR struct = `uint8_t lt/gt/eq/so`. Cross-referenced EVERY subtle op against
  RexGlue's recomp of this exact XEX (`generated/default/*`): carry ops, packs (operand order `(op2,op1)`),
  `vpkuhus` (unsigned-sat = `packus_epi16(min_epu16(op2,0xFF), min_epu16(op1,0xFF))` — matches RexGlue's
  16-lane scalar exactly), `vcfpuxws128`=`simde_mm_vctuxs`, `vslo`=`simde_mm_vslo`, `vsel128`≡`VSEL`.
- **[22:52] BATCH 1 (scalar) DONE — 10,960 → 10,363 (−597, exact).** Added `addc addme subfze bdzf
  bdnzt cror crorc`. All 7 verified ABSENT from histogram; build + recompile clean. Each emit cross-checked
  byte-for-byte vs RexGlue (carry = ADDE/SUBFE two-term form, alias-safe ordering; CR-bit branches select
  the REAL bit via `cr(BI/4).{lt,gt,eq,so}[BI%4]`, not hard-coded eq; `cror/crorc` = per-CR-bit logical).
  Patch regenerated, committed (`8e1e0dd`).
- **[23:05] BATCH 2 (vector analogs) DONE — 10,363 → 94 (−10,269, exact).** Added 26 vector ops:
  `vslh vsrh vsrah vsrab vrlh` (per-lane scalar shift/rotate), `vsubshs vmaxsh vminsh vminsw vsububm
  vaddsbs vsubsbs vavguh` (direct simde intrinsics), `vaddsws vavgsw` (int64-clamp scalar like `VSUBSWS`),
  `vspltish` (`set1_epi16`), `vcmpgtsh vcmpgtsw vcmpequh` (compare + CR6 `setFromMask`: 0xFFFF int-overload
  for halfword, 0xF float-overload for word), `vpkshss(128) vpkswss(128) vpkswus(128) vpkuhus(128)` (packs,
  operand order `(op2,op1)`; vpkuhus = `packus_epi16(min_epu16(·,0xFF), …)`), `stvebx` (single-byte element
  store). Aliased `vsel128`→`VSEL` (identical operands) and `lvehx`→`LVX` group (⚠ RexGlue treats `lvehx`
  as a FULL aligned vector load, not single-element — matched the validated reference, not the bare spec).
  Build + recompile clean; all 26 ABSENT. Remaining **94** = `vcfpuxws128`(73)+`vslo`(14)+`vslo128`(7),
  needing 2 `ppc_context.h` helpers (Batch 3). Committed (`d7f16e5`).
- **[23:20] BATCH 3 (helper-backed) DONE — 94 → 0.  🎯 TASK 1 COMPLETE: INSTRUCTION GAP FULLY CLOSED
  (13,183 → 0).** Added `vcfpuxws128` (float→uint saturate; unsigned analog of `VCTSXS`, `.u32` store) +
  `vslo`/`vslo128` (shift-left-by-octet), backed by 2 helpers ported into `XenonUtils/ppc_context.h`
  (`simde_mm_vctuxs`, `simde_mm_vslo`) verbatim from RexGlue's validated `rex::ppc` runtime (`vslo`
  simplified to a portable byte-loop — both SDK arch branches were identical). Recompile = **0 unrecognized**,
  90 generated TUs.
- **[23:24] TASK 3 (syntax-clean) DONE.** All 90 generated `ppc_recomp.*.cpp` + `ppc_func_mapping.cpp`
  pass `clang++ -std=c++20 -fsyntax-only` (parallel over all cores, **zero FAILs**) — validates both the new
  emitter cases AND the 2 new `ppc_context.h` helpers compile. The patch now spans `recompiler.cpp` +
  `ppc_context.h`. Committed (`ec0f24b`).
- **[23:55] TASK 2 (jump tables) — XenonAnalyse extended; 93 validated tables shipped (was 0).**
  Root cause of "0 detected": SP's MSVC-360 (a) inserts alignment NOPs mid-prologue and (b) emits
  `rlwinm` BEFORE the table-base `addi` (vs Unleashed) — defeating XenonAnalyse's fixed-sequence
  `SearchMask` + `ReadTable`'s hardcoded operand offsets. Fix (`XenonAnalyse/main.cpp`): NOP-tolerant
  `SearchMask`; role-based `ReadTableSP` (finds lis/addi/load/rlwinm by opcode, derives TYPE from the
  load op — order/NOP independent, reuses XA's address arithmetic); 2 SP-ordered patterns. → XA now
  detects **102 tables**. VALIDATION (safety): each candidate cross-checked vs RexGlue — 67 exact-match,
  35 all-labels-are-RexGlue-jump-targets, **0 misreads** (a wrong base shifts labels off all 98,729 loc
  targets; none did). Of 102, **93 are fully in-bounds → shipped** in `sp_switch_tables.toml`; **9 are
  boundary-limited → deferred**. Recompile = 0 unrecognized, **0 switch-case errors**, 93 `switch`
  statements emitted (were PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC). Re-ran TASK 3 syntax check WITH tables = all 90 TUs
  pass. Tooling + pipeline: `varianta/tools/jumptables/`. Patch now also spans `XenonAnalyse/main.cpp`.
  - ⚠ **FLAGGED (function-boundary problem, README §"Function Boundary Analysis" — no auto-solution):**
    the 9 deferred tables AND 161 pre-existing `// ERROR <addr>` (no-colon) CONDITIONAL-branch markers
    share one root cause — XenonAnalyse splits functions at computed-jump targets, so some branch/case
    targets land outside their function. Verified switch tables add ZERO errors (count identical with/
    without tables; switch-case errors `// ERROR:`-with-colon = 0). Fix path = manual function-boundary
    overrides or a boundary-analyzer extension (separate task). Committed (`4ae4809`).
- **[00:30] TASK 4 (host-runtime) — SCAFFOLD + full enumeration (the large remaining phase; bounded).**
  Recovered the recompiler ABI from `ppc_context.h`: `PPC_FUNC(f)=void f(PPCContext&,uint8_t* base)`,
  guest memory = `base+addr` (4 GiB, byte-swapped), indirect dispatch via `PPC_LOOKUP_FUNC`+
  `PPCFuncMappings[]`. Surface: **22,782** recompiled guest funcs + **474** kernel/xam imports to
  implement (Xam 44, Nt 30, Net 28, Ke 26, Rtl 21, Vd 20, Ex 11, …) — RexGlue's `rexglue-sdk/src/`
  implements all (1:1 behaviour ref). Built `varianta/runtime/`: `IMPORTS-TODO.md` (categorized list),
  `gen_import_stubs.py` (emits 474 trap-stubs so the image links — uses plain `PPC_FUNC` to match the
  C++-linkage `PPC_EXTERN_FUNC` import decls in `ppc_recomp_shared.h`), `CMakeLists.txt` (globs ppc/ +
  runtime/), `host_stub.cpp` (placeholder main + loader TODOs), `README.md` (completion path). Validated:
  stubs + host_stub object-compile clean; import symbols defined with correct mangled C++ linkage
  (`_Z15__imp__DbgPrintR10PPCContextPh`). NOT done: full 90-TU build/link (heavy/open-ended) and the
  real runtime (memory+loader+imports+entry) — that's the multi-week phase; scaffold is ready to build.
- **[00:30] TASK 4 LINK-WITH-STUBS — SUCCEEDED.** Built all 93 TUs with clang++ -O0 (89 `ppc_recomp` +
  `ppc_func_mapping` + 474-stub `import_stubs.gen.cpp` + `host_stub`) and **linked → `sp_td_varianta`
  (103 MB), 0 undefined symbols, 0 errors**; the exe runs (prints the scaffold notice, exits 0). This
  proves all **22,782** recompiled functions + the 474 import stubs form a coherent, linkable program —
  and confirms the ONLY external references are the enumerated imports (no hidden missing symbols). TASK
  4's stated night-scope (CMake skeleton + link-with-stubs + enumeration) is now COMPLETE. Booting needs
  the real runtime (deferred per the directive: "Don't try to boot... renderer is the phase after").

## Continuation 2026-06-01 — host-runtime phase (user chose "start the host runtime")
- **[06:08] RUNTIME BRING-UP MILESTONE — the guest boots and runs real code.** Wrote
  `varianta/runtime/runtime.cpp`: reserve 4 GiB (`mmap` MAP_NORESERVE) → load+parse the XEX via
  XenonUtils `Image` (links prebuilt `libXenonUtils/disasm/fmt`) → map the 17 sections (skip
  `.reloc`/`.pdata`: not runtime data, and xex.cpp's decompressed image buffer is smaller than
  `image.size` so `.reloc` straddled the tail and faulted `memcpy`) → populate the **22,782-entry**
  dispatch table (`PPC_LOOKUP_FUNC` layout) → init `PPCContext` + a guest stack (SP=0x700FFE00) →
  call entry `0x824499A0`. Result: **the guest executes and runs until the first kernel import,
  `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`** (CRT heap setup; SIGILL from its trap-stub). The full
  load→dispatch→execute path works end-to-end. Next: implement the early-boot import cascade
  (make the 474 stubs `weak`, add strong impls in a `kernel.cpp` + a guest heap allocator).
- **[06:15] Import-cascade harness + first imports.** Made the 474 trap-stubs `weak`
  (`gen_import_stubs.py`) so strong impls in `runtime/kernel.cpp` override them — the scalable pattern.
  Implemented `NtAllocateVirtualMemory` (guest bump-heap at 0x40000000, 64 KiB granularity) and
  `KeGetCurrentProcessType` (→1 = title). Boot now advances import-by-import. **Current frontier:
  `RtlInitializeCriticalSection`** (rexglue-sdk ref `kernel/xboxkrnl/xboxkrnl_rtl.cpp`: header.type=1,
  lock_count=-1, recursion_count=0, owning_thread=0; then Rtl{Enter,Leave,TryEnter}CriticalSection).
  The cascade (critical sections → TLS → XConfig → threads → … → Vd* video → render) is the ongoing
  multi-week grind; each import's behaviour comes 1:1 from `rexglue-sdk/src/`. Checkpointing the loop
  here (commit + continue) after the boot milestone.
- **[06:45] KPCR set up; boot bail traced into `_xstart` CRT init.** Implemented critical-section trio
  + `HalReturnToFirmware` (logged exit) + a `REX_KTRACE` import trace. Found the thread mechanism
  (rexglue `kernel/crt/threading.cpp`): **`r13` = guest KPCR pointer**; X_KPCR (size 0x2D8): tls_ptr@0x0,
  stack_base_ptr@0x70, stack_end_ptr@0x74, prcb_data@0x100 (X_KPRCB.current_thread@0x0), prcb@0x2A8.
  Set up a minimal guest KPCR/KTHREAD/TLS in `runtime.cpp` + `r13=0x60000000`. **Boot trace unchanged**
  (NtAllocateVirtualMemory×2 → KeGetCurrentProcessType → RtlInitializeCriticalSection(cs=**0x618**) →
  HalReturnToFirmware(1) [exit]) ⇒ cs=0x618 is NOT derived from the current-thread pointer. Entry =
  **`_xstart`** (Xbox CRT startup, `ppc_recomp.65.cpp:1716`, NOT a `sub_`): sets 2 globals @0x82590000+
  to −1 → `sub_82450580` → `sub_8244EA18(1)` → `sub_824497B8` (return checked vs 0, branches); the bail
  `HalReturnToFirmware` is at `ppc_recomp.65.cpp:22221`. **NEXT (fresh context):** trace which init
  sub-fn computes `cs=0x618` (≈ `r2/TOC+0x618` or a null-global deref) and reaches HalReturnToFirmware;
  check whether `r2`/TOC or a loader-provided global must be initialized before `_xstart`. Deep
  boot-path debugging. Committed; checkpoint.
- **[06:50] Bail = CRT computing null-based addresses ⇒ needs systemic entry-environment setup.**
  Traced cs=0x618: `RtlInitializeCriticalSection` caller-lr=0x8244B874 (inside `sub_8244B380`),
  **r2=0x0**, r13=0x60000000. cs=r29, and r29 is reloaded from a caller-provided stack slot
  ([r31+316] = caller frame); 0x618 ≈ null-base+0x618 threaded up the call chain. **ROOT: `_xstart`
  expects a fuller loader-provided entry environment than set up.** Candidates: (a) **r2 / SDA base**
  (currently 0), (b) the **XEX TLS-directory static init** — `KPCR.tls_ptr` points at a ZEROED block,
  (c) entry-arg registers r3/r4, (d) XEX static initializers. This is the systemic multi-day piece
  (UnleashedRecomp/Xenia implement it extensively). Hand-tracing recompiled CRT code is low-velocity;
  **NEXT should set up the entry environment comprehensively** — parse the XEX PE TLS directory (at
  base+IMAGE_BASE) + copy static TLS data + research the correct entry registers (r2/r3) from
  rexglue/Xenia — rather than chase individual null derefs. ⚠ Reality check: a full boot is the
  multi-week runtime tail; the loop is grinding it but velocity is now low per iteration. Committed
  (lr/r2/r13 trace); checkpoint.
- **[07:10] Bail localized to CRT heap-init `sub_8244B380` returning 0 (via gdb backtraces).** Chain:
  `main→_xstart→sub_82450580→sub_824504A8→sub_8244B380→RtlInitCS(cs=0x618)`. `sub_82450580` bails to
  `HalReturnToFirmware` IFF `sub_824504A8` returns 0, and `sub_824504A8` returns `(sub_8244B380_result
  != 0)` — so the CRT heap/pool init `sub_8244B380(type=2, size=4096)` FAILS. ✅ **KPCR works** — gdb
  shows `r25=0x60001000` = my KTHREAD (current-thread link resolves). ❌ heap control-block base is
  `null+0x618` (`cs=0x618`, `r30=0x640`) — a NULL pointer, almost certainly read from the **ZEROED
  KTHREAD/process** objects. `sub_8244B380` also calls `NtQueryVirtualMemory`/`NtFreeVirtualMemory`
  (still trap-stubs, untaken branch). ⚠ Open puzzle: `r29=[r31+316]=r4(entry)`; static call site
  (`sub_824504A8:22137`) sets `r4=0`, yet runtime `r29=0x618` — resolve via a gdb watchpoint on
  `[r31+316]`. **NEXT: populate the guest thread/process/default-heap environment** (X_KTHREAD +
  process object + process heap) so the CRT finds a valid heap base. Velocity low; full boot = the
  multi-week tail. Checkpoint.

## PAUSE POINT — 2026-06-01 ~07:40 (autonomous loop paused for consolidation)
gdb shows the boot reaches the CRT heap-init with MULTIPLE `RtlInitCS` calls (cs=0/0x618; one with
`r30=0x100000` = the real NtAlloc heap, so partial heap setup DOES work) failing on null-based pointers
read from the **zeroed thread/process structures**. The CRT control flow + stack-spilled locals do not
trace cleanly statically, and per-iteration velocity on this archaeology is low. **Decision: pause the
self-running loop here.** The deterministic front (doc TASK 1–4) is COMPLETE and committed; the runtime
boot is the genuine multi-week tail, better advanced as focused systematic work than 20-min autonomous
null-chasing.

### What works (committed)
Load+parse XEX → map 17 sections → 22,782-fn dispatch table → init PPCContext+stack+KPCR/KTHREAD → call
`_xstart`; guest executes real code; imports resolve via weak-stub/`kernel.cpp` (NtAllocateVirtualMemory,
KeGetCurrentProcessType, critical-section trio, HalReturnToFirmware). KPCR current-thread link verified.

### Systematic next-steps (priority order; the multi-week tail)
1. **Full guest thread/process env** — populate `X_KTHREAD` (process ptr, TLS, thread id, stack
   base/limit), a `X_KPROCESS` object, and the **default process heap**, matching what the recompiled
   CRT reads (ref: rexglue-sdk `X_KTHREAD`/`X_KPROCESS` + its thread-init in `system/xthread.cpp`).
2. **XEX TLS-directory static init** (`KPCR.tls_ptr` currently → a zeroed block).
3. **Early-boot import cascade** as it surfaces: `NtQueryVirtualMemory`, `NtFreeVirtualMemory`,
   `RtlAllocateHeap`, … — behaviour 1:1 from `rexglue-sdk/src/`.
4. Then threading → `Vd*` video → native renderer (Plume + 19 shaders).

### Tooling that works
gdb backtraces (recompiled fns are real host frames at `-O0`); `REX_KTRACE=1` import trace; the
`varianta/runtime/` scaffold (`gen_import_stubs.py`, CMake links prebuilt `libXenonUtils`).

**Resume:** re-run `/loop go done docs/NEXT-SESSION-VARIANTA-PROMPT.md`, or tackle the systematic steps
interactively (recommended for the runtime).

## Session 2026-06-01 (continuation) — heap unblocked → full boot env → multithreaded video init
Goal: fill X_KTHREAD/X_KPROCESS/process heap → static TLS from XEX → import cascade → video → renderer.
Commits (NOT pushed): `8b6d18b`, `db90322`, `48f217d`, `e0f4e8a`, `b086014`.

- **[8b6d18b] HEAP-INIT BLOCKER FIXED — the root cause was a wrong NtAllocateVirtualMemory ABI.**
  The pause-point bail (CRT `RtlCreateHeap`=`sub_8244B380` getting a null heap base) was NOT a missing
  thread/process struct — it was that NtAllocateVirtualMemory used the **Windows 6-arg** signature
  (`ProcessHandle, *BaseAddress, ZeroBits, *RegionSize, …`) but Xbox 360 passes only
  `(*BaseAddress=r3, *RegionSize=r4, AllocType=r5, Protect=r6, Debug=r7)`. It read the *size* as the
  base and never wrote `*BaseAddress` → heap base 0 → lock CS at null+0x618. Rewrote a tracking memory
  manager (std::map over the lazily-mmap'd 4 GiB) for Nt{Allocate,Query,Free}VirtualMemory. RtlCreateHeap
  now succeeds (1 MB reserve @ 0x40000000, lock CS at a valid 0x40000618). **This retires the "needs
  X_KTHREAD/X_KPROCESS" framing of the pause point — the structs weren't the blocker; the ABI was.**
- **[db90322] Full boot environment + static TLS (goal steps 1-2 DONE).** `SetupEnvironment` builds, 1:1
  with rexglue (Xenia) layouts: title X_KPROCESS (TLS vars + slot bitmap from XEX_HEADER_TLS_INFO),
  main-thread X_KTHREAD (InitializeGuestObject, linked into process), X_KPCR (r13). Per-thread TLS block
  initialized from the XEX TLS directory. Implemented KeTlsAlloc/Free/Get/SetValue (process slot bitmap +
  per-thread dynamic array via r13→KPCR→thread), KeQueryPerformanceFrequency (50 MHz), KeQuerySystemTime,
  XexCheckExecutablePrivilege. Switched the 474 stubs to **soft** (log+return 0; REX_STUBTRAP=1 to trap)
  → one run maps the whole cascade. This title has NO static TLS data (only 64 dynamic slots).
- **[48f217d] Data imports → boot reaches GPU video init.** XGetVideoMode (1280x720), MmAllocatePhysicalMemoryEx,
  ExGetXConfigSetting, RtlInitAnsiString. Boot advances through CRT init into the Vd* GPU init cascade
  (VdInitializeRingBuffer/EnableRingBufferRPtrWriteBack/SetGraphicsInterruptCallback) and parks in the
  main-thread GPU ring-buffer/vblank spin **sub_821B9270** (no GPU to advance the RPtr/vblank).
- **[e0f4e8a] Real threading + Vd* vblank pump → boot goes MULTITHREADED, past the GPU spin.**
  ExCreateThread spawns a host std::thread running the guest start routine (XAPI trampoline / raw) on its
  own KTHREAD/KPCR/TLS/stack (factored CreateGuestThreadContext + FillKThread/FillKPcr). Handle table:
  NtResumeThread, ObReferenceObjectByHandle (+NtCurrentThread), ObDereferenceObject, KeSetAffinityThread,
  KeInitializeDpc. Critical sections are now REAL per-CS recursive host mutexes; memory manager mutex-guarded.
  A ~60 Hz vblank pump thread fires the guest graphics interrupt callback on its own context. The audio
  worker is created+resumed+runs; boot reaches audio init.
- **[b086014] Sync primitives + memory layout.** Events/semaphores/single+multiple waits (one global CV;
  signal_state in the guest dispatch header @+0x04); threads signal their KTHREAD header on exit. Memory
  layout: guest virtual bump now starts LOW (0x10000) so the title's big heap reserve (everything below its
  ~0x70000000 stack) ends below the image (0x82000000) instead of overwriting `.data`; kernel arena +
  worker structs/stacks moved ABOVE the image (0x90000000+). REX_NOSPAWN diagnostic gate.

### CURRENT FRONTIER — audio-subsystem init logic (race FIXED by the cooperative token, commit e56368f)
The concurrency race is RESOLVED: the cooperative execution token (`g_waitMutex`; only one guest thread
runs at a time, released across waits / CS contention) made the boot **deterministic** (3/3 identical).
Remaining is now a stable LOGIC bug, not a race:
- A/B (REX_NOSPAWN): workers OFF → main sails to `XamLoaderLaunchTitle` (then hangs waiting for the un-run
  worker); workers ON (default) → deterministic crash at `sub_8229C4B0` (ppc_recomp.37:11442, `[r3+0]`)
  called from `sub_8214FFD0:20349` (`r3 = [r27+4] = -1`).
- Watchpoint: `[0x828C124C]` is written ONCE, by the main thread, to a VALID `0x806F0200` (so that global
  is fine); the crashing `[r27+4]` is a DIFFERENT subsystem-object slot that stays -1. `sub_8214FFD0` looks
  like a generic "init subsystem N → register object → spawn its worker (sub_8229C4B0 creates a thread for
  `[r27+4]`)". When the audio worker (`sub_8230E898`, started via the XAPI trampoline 0x82450FD0) runs, a
  later subsystem's object pointer is left -1 because its imports are soft-stubs.
- The crash deref faults only because it reads 4 bytes straddling the top of the 4 GiB mmap (r3 = -1 = top
  of guest space). Any real pointer there would load fine.
- ✅ **The cascade DOES advance one step per correct import** (confirmed): implementing XamUserGetSigninInfo
  (fill the 40-B X_USER_SIGNIN_INFO; the stub returned S_OK without writing it) moved the frontier forward
  — the user/profile subsystem now calls **XamUserReadProfileSettings** (current last stub). So the path is
  the import-cascade grind: implement the next profile/file import → advance → repeat. The unset `[r27+4]`
  object belongs to a subsystem whose init reads profile/file data that the stubs don't provide yet.
- Memory layout verified correct: the title's 1.88 GB heap reserve now lands at base 0x48D0000 (ends
  0x749D0000, **below** the image 0x82000000); kernel arena + worker stacks at 0x90000000+.

### ⏩ UPDATE — cascade cleared, boot reaches the GPU command-processor boundary (commits through case-insensitive VFS)
The -1 subsystem WAS the asset/profile subsystem; resolved it by walking the cascade with correct imports:
XamUserGetSigninInfo → XamUserReadProfileSettings (0-settings) → then the **file VFS**. Implemented a
read-only VFS (Nt{CreateFile,OpenFile,ReadFile,QueryInformationFile,SetInformationFile,Close}) that maps
guest `game:\…` → `<g_gameDir>/…` (the extracted dir, from the XEX path), **case-insensitively** (Xbox FS
is case-insensitive; the title opens `UI\`/`Audio\` but the extract is lowercase `ui`/`audio` — that
mismatch was the last crash). Now `default.xex`/`SouthParkXact.xgs`/`ArcadeLogo.ptc`/`UI.xzp` all open OK and
**the crash is GONE (exit 139 → 124)**. The boot loads assets + allocates GPU physical memory, then
**deadlocks at the GPU ring-buffer spin `sub_821B9270`** (a worker busy-polls the RPtr write-back for the
GPU to "catch up"; it needs a command processor to advance RPtr — and it holds the cooperative token while
spinning, starving everything else). **This is the GPU-CP / renderer boundary (goal step 5).**

### Revised next-steps
1. **GPU command processor (the frontier).** Mechanism (traced): the spin `sub_821B9270` does
   `r11=[r29+10896]` (ptr to the RPtr write-back = `g_rptrWriteBack`), `r8=[r11]` (current RPtr),
   `r9=[r31+8]` (the expected/target = where the CPU's WPtr is) and loops `while (r9 != r8)`. So it waits
   for **RPtr to reach WPtr**. The guest publishes WPtr by writing GPU register **0x01C5 = CP_RB_WPTR**
   (rexglue `graphics_system.cpp:278`) via an MMIO store to the GPU register window — which my FLAT 4 GiB
   map does NOT intercept (the store just lands in memory, no side effect). Two ways to get WPtr:
   (a) find the CP_RB_WPTR guest address (GPU register base + 0x01C5*4 = +0x714; the base comes from the
   ring-buffer/Vd* setup or the device struct `r29` — trace `r29` and its +10888/+10896/+11008 fields), then
   a host GPU thread POLLS it and writes `[g_rptrWriteBack] = WPtr` (no token; pure memory write) → the spin
   exits; or (b) add real MMIO write-interception for the GPU register range (rexglue `mmio_handler.cpp`).
   (a) is the quick "null GPU" that should release the spin → boot proceeds. THEN the real renderer: parse +
   translate the PM4 stream the ring buffer holds → draws (Plume + the 19 shaders in
   `private/extracted/media/shaders/*.updb`; Unleashed `gpu/video.cpp` ref). Multi-week.
2. **Threading model (interlocks with #1).** Findings (commit w/ REX_NOTOKEN gate): PREEMPTIVE threads
   (`REX_NOTOKEN=1`) hang EARLIER (line 43, XamInputSetState) — worse. COOPERATIVE (default token) reaches
   asset-load + GPU init but is **non-deterministic** in *thread-ordering* (the token serializes execution,
   not the OS-scheduled handoff order) → different runs stop at the GPU spin / `RtlRaiseException` / a crash.
   The worker that hits the GPU spin has `r29=0` (**null GPU device**) = token-starvation: it busy-waits
   holding the token for device state the (blocked) main thread would produce. **Proper fix = a
   DETERMINISTIC cooperative scheduler (real fibers, like RexGlue: `rex/thread/fiber.h`) with explicit
   yield ordering + a PARALLEL host GPU thread** that advances RPtr by writing guest memory directly (so a
   busy-waiting fiber's condition becomes true without the fiber yielding). This is the core
   GPU-CP/threading-architecture rework — multi-week.
3. `RtlRaiseException` (a now-reachable frontier on some interleavings) = guest SEH; XenonRecomp models SEH
   via setjmp/longjmp — implement RtlRaiseException to drive the guest __except path (or it's a benign
   "feature probe" the title raises + catches).
4. Remaining soft-stubs surface as the boot proceeds (more Xam, audio XAudio*, input) — implement as hit.

### Systematic next-steps (priority order)
1. ✅ **DONE — cooperative execution token** (commit e56368f): the boot is now deterministic. (Ruled out:
   broken atomics — XenonRecomp emits real `__sync_bool_compare_and_swap` for `lwarx/stwcx`.)
2. **Resolve the subsystem-init -1.** Find which subsystem `sub_8214FFD0` is initializing when `[r27+4]`
   is -1: break at `ppc_recomp.6.cpp:20349`, read `r27` (the object-slot global) and trace back which
   `sub_*`/import was supposed to populate it. Likely it needs a subsystem import currently soft-stubbed
   (audio: XAudioRegisterRenderDriverClient/GetSpeakerConfig/GetVoiceCategoryVolume; or a Xam/notify one)
   to return a valid handle/object instead of 0. Implement that import for real (ref rexglue-sdk
   `src/audio/` + `src/kernel/xam/`). ⚠ gdb live-inspection of `ctx.*` fields interacts badly with the
   token under all-stop — prefer `REX_KTRACE=1` tracing + targeted `fprintf` over breakpoint scripts, or
   set `REX_NOSPAWN=1` to inspect the single-threaded path.
3. ⚠ **Pending hazard — GPU-spin starvation under the token.** The main-thread GPU spin `sub_821B9270`
   (`db16cyc` busy-loop, calls `sub_8244CE40` each iteration) doesn't yield, so once reached it will hold
   the token forever and starve the vblank pump → hang. Make `sub_8244CE40` (or the spin) release the
   token (it's likely a delay/yield), or detect the spin and yield. Needed before the GPU sync can drive.
4. Implement the spinlock imports (Kf/KeAcquire/ReleaseSpinLock*, KeEnter/LeaveCriticalRegion) as real
   token-releasing locks (referenced in 3-6 TUs; not yet hit pre-crash).
5. Then the cascade past audio: file VFS (NtCreateFile/NtReadFile/NtQueryInformationFile/NtClose backed
   by the extracted game dir), XamLoaderLaunchTitle → GPU command processor (consume the PM4 ring buffer)
   → native renderer (Plume + 19 shaders).
2. Implement the spinlock imports (Kf/KeAcquire/ReleaseSpinLock*, KeEnter/LeaveCriticalRegion) as real
   host locks — these guard kernel-level shared structures the threads touch.
3. Then continue the cascade past audio: file VFS (NtCreateFile/NtReadFile/NtQueryInformationFile/NtClose
   backed by the extracted game dir) for asset loading, XamLoaderLaunchTitle.
4. Then the GPU command processor (consume the PM4 ring buffer the title fills) → native renderer
   (Plume + 19 shaders). The vblank pump already fires the interrupt callback; RPtr write-back is tracked.

### Tooling added this session
`REX_STUBTRAP=1` (hard-trap unimplemented imports), `REX_NOSPAWN=1` (create thread handles but don't run
them — isolates concurrency bugs). gdb hardware watchpoints on `g_base+<guestaddr>` pinpoint who writes a
guest global (and which host thread). Build: `cmake --build runtime/out --target sp_td_varianta` then
`./sp_td_varianta <abs path to default.xex>`.

### UPDATE 2 — FP-mask unlock crosses the device build; dual frontier (jump-tables + GPU)
Major: a zeroed `PPCContext{}.fpscr.csr` made the guest's first `setcsr` unmask host FP exceptions, so
every `fctidz` trapped (SIGFPE inexact). Init `ctx.fpscr.csr=0x1F80` (all 3 context sites) crossed the
ENTIRE device-build FP cascade at once. + `VdQueryVideoMode` (device build calls it, was unfilled→div0)
+ `KeDelayExecutionThread`/`NtDelayExecution` as token-yielding sleeps (broke the GPU-init hang). Boot now
runs deep into GPU/render init on the main thread. NEW frontier is DUAL: (1) the **function-boundary /
jump-table problem** resurfaces at runtime — `sub_821DC228:17351` computed-jumps through a table @0x8221C244
that XenonAnalyse missed → recompiler emitted `PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC(0x821DC29C)` (a mid-function LABEL,
not a function) → null dispatch → PC=0 SIGSEGV. Fix = recover the table into `sp_switch_tables.toml` +
regenerate ppc/ (likely several such tables). (2) the GPU engine (device reads 0 GPU registers; CP/PM4/Plume).

---

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — jump-table robustness + cooperative wait: boot 127 → ~10,500 trace-lines

Two committed fixes (`23bf29b`, `1d435a1`; NOT pushed) took the boot from a hard crash at the first
runtime jump table to ~10,500 trace-lines deep, across video init and UI asset load.

### Fix 1 — ALL jump-table switches hardened (the dominant blocker)
The function-boundary jump table (`sub_821DC228`, the float-store dispatcher) didn't just need recovery —
its recovered switch emitted `default: __builtin_unreachable()`. At `-O0`, that lets clang DROP the switch
bounds-check and compile a raw `jmp *table[idx]`. The caller's data-driven loop ran the index to 22 (the
table has 22 entries 0..21), so `jmp *table[22]` read one slot past the host jump table and jumped to
**host address 0** — a fatal crash with a wiped register/frame context (rip=0, rsi=0, zeroed stack).
On real hardware index 22 is *also* out of range, so the title never emits it there; ours diverged.

Fix (toolchain + runtime, hardens all 93 tables at once):
- `recompiler.cpp` (in `patches/xenonrecomp-sp-instructions.patch`, now 663 lines): the switch `default`
  now does the **real computed jump** `PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC(ctr)` — exactly what the original `bctr`
  does (`ctr` already holds the HW target from the preceding `mtctr`). `__builtin_unreachable` is gone
  from every generated switch. Regenerated `ppc/` (88 TUs).
- `rex_indirect.h` + `kernel.cpp`: every indirect branch now routes through a bounds-checked
  **`PPCInvokeGuest`** — it only indexes the function table for targets in `[PPC_CODE_BASE, IMAGE_END)`,
  else logs+skips (`INDIRECT-NULL`). Without the bound, a wild target's table slot lands GiB past the
  4 GiB guest map and faults the *lookup read itself*. The macro is now a 1-liner → helper, so future
  dispatch-policy tweaks recompile only `kernel.cpp`, not all ~90 TUs.

### Fix 2 — real `NtWaitForMultipleObjectsEx`
Was a soft stub returning success instantly → tid=6 (`sub_821E61A8`) busy-spun (WaitAny on two events,
infinite timeout). Implemented as the handle-based sibling of `KeWaitForMultipleObjects` (ResolveObject
each handle → same cooperative wait core). Crossed the spin → the main thread progressed to loading
`game:\UI\UI.xzp` (`NtReadFile` now returns 23.5 MB of real data) and reached `XamLoaderLaunchTitle`.

### NEW FRONTIER — a CRT static-init divergence (precise; resume here)
Main thread: `_xstart → sub_82249638 → sub_82249678 → sub_8214FFD0 → sub_8229C4B0`.
`sub_8229C4B0` is the constructor of the global object at `0x828E3A38`. At `ppc_recomp.37.cpp:8362-8388`
it calls `sub_82201800(r4 = &field@0x828E825C)` to build a sub-object, reads it back, and — if null —
defensively `goto loc_8229C59C`, which reads `*(r1+80)`. On the null-skip path that stack slot is
**uninitialized = 0xFFFFFFFF**, so `lwz r11,0(r3)` reads `base + 0xFFFFFFFF` (crossing the 4 GiB end) →
SIGSEGV.

Why the field is null: inside `sub_82201800` (`ppc_recomp.22.cpp:14784+`) the allocation
`sub_82448090(96)` **succeeds** (→`0xd89d0`), but the init `sub_822009F0(r3=obj, r4=0x828c3830)`
**returns `0x8030001C`** (sev=error, facility 0x30, code 0x1c). Line 14820 `bge` then takes the error
path, so the store `*(r29=0x828E825C) = r31(obj)` at `:14841` is **skipped** → field stays null.

⇒ Root-cause `sub_822009F0` (`ppc_recomp.22.cpp:~12560+`, a long chain of `PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC`
virtual calls): which virtual call / resource lookup yields `0x8030001C`. Likely shares a root with the
**count divergence** (`sub_821E07A0`'s loop bound = `*(u16)(sub_821E0150_ret + 31)`; runs ~10k → 10,347
`INDIRECT-NULL` skips). Leading hypotheses for the shared root: the ~48-instruction recomp gap (esp. VMX
lanes) silently mis-emitting a computation; a missing import returning wrong data; or an asset-parse
mismatch. Method: `gdb -batch`, `break ppc_recomp.N.cpp:LINE`, read `ctx.rN.u32` / `base` (the `-O0`
host frames + file:line map cleanly). Then: more init → the GPU engine (PM4 / register MMIO / Plume +
19 shaders) — still multi-week.

### Frontier fully traced — XUI resource-header validation (sub_82244378), and instruction-gap RULED OUT
Followed the `0x8030001C` error down 8 levels of the static-init virtual-dispatch chain
(`sub_822009F0:12679 → sub_822000A0:11159 → … → sub_82244378`). `sub_82244378`
(`ppc_recomp.28.cpp:14315-14353`) is a **XUI resource-header validator**:
- `*(r1+112) == 0x5855495A` ("XUIZ" magic) — **passes**.
- `*(r1+80) == 22` (size) — **passes**. ⚠ Read `ctx.rN.u32` (the byte-swapped guest value), not raw
  `*(uint*)(base+addr)`; the raw bytes read `0x16000000` and *look* like a byte-order bug but are not —
  `PPC_LOAD_U32`/`lwz` swaps them to 22.
- **FAILS at `:14351`** `cmplw cr6,r31,r3`: `*(r1+120) = 0x167d346` (a heap object) vs the virtual call
  at `:14349` — `sub_82469FD0`, a trivial getter `r3 = *(this+8)` — which returns **`0x700ff800`, a
  STACK address**. They must be equal; they differ → `goto loc_82244740` → builds `0x8030001C`.

Root: the XUI-loader object at `0xd8a70` was constructed with its **+8 field = a stack pointer** where a
persistent heap object is expected — an object-identity/lifetime divergence during XUI resource
construction (its own root is further upstream). Next: trace who constructs `object@0xd8a70`, what
`*(r1+120) = 0x167d346` is, and why `+8` holds a stack address.

**Instruction gap RULED OUT as the cause:** a full regen reports ZERO "Unrecognized instruction"; the
only warning is `vcmpgtuh.` ×39 (a VMX compare-with-record not setting CR6 — irrelevant to this scalar
CRT/XUI path). So the divergence is **data/semantic** (object construction), not codegen. The count
divergence in `sub_821E07A0` (~10k) is likely the same family.

Method that worked well for this archaeology: `gdb -batch`, `break ppc_recomp.N.cpp:LINE`, inspect
`ctx.rN.u32` / `base` (the `-O0` host frames + file:line map cleanly; finish/return-value reads are
flaky inside `commands` blocks — break at the post-call line instead).

### Rule-outs + reframe (the XUI divergence is an earlier systemic root, needs bisection)
A watchpoint on the XUI object's `+8` field (guest `0xd8a78`) shows that memory is **reused** across
objects: written `0xf80f70` (valid heap) by the ctor `sub_82244200`, then `0xf87300`, then `0x65007300`
(UTF-16 "e\0s\0" — string data) by `sub_824294B0`. So the failing validation reads a `+8` that belongs
to a *recycled* allocation — an object-lifetime/ordering divergence, downstream of an earlier root rather
than a local bug at `sub_82244378`.

Hypotheses eliminated:
- **Instruction gap** — full regen: zero "Unrecognized instruction"; only `vcmpgtuh.` (VMX CR-record),
  irrelevant to this scalar path.
- **`XamLoaderLaunchTitle`** — called with a NULL path (relaunch-self), BUT the reference build
  (`third_party/rexglue-sdk`, which renders this title fully) **also stubs it** (`REX_EXPORT_STUB` in
  `xam_misc.cpp`). So a no-op return is correct; not the divergence.
- **vtable / function-pointer resolution** — the failing virtual call resolved to the correct guest
  function (`sub_82469FD0`, a real getter). Dispatch is fine.

⇒ The remaining cause class is a **runtime-HLE import returning different data than rexglue-sdk**, or a
*handled-but-subtly-wrong* instruction, corrupting object data early (same family as the `sub_821E07A0`
count divergence). Localizing it efficiently wants a **guest-level reference comparison**: both variant A
and rexglue-sdk execute the *same* guest code at the *same* guest addresses, so capturing guest
memory/registers at a shared guest PC (e.g. entry of `sub_82244378` or `sub_821E07A0`) in both builds and
diffing pinpoints the first divergence — far cheaper than descending each crash by hand. (rexglue-sdk is a
different *recomp* so host addresses differ, but guest state should match a correct emulation.) Do NOT
modify the prod `.so`; trace read-only.

Net for the session: boot advanced 127 → ~10,500 trace-lines across video init + UI load; the blocking
crash is precisely localized and three root hypotheses eliminated. Reaching a rendered frame still
requires resolving the init divergence (above) AND then building the GPU engine (PM4 → Plume + 19
shaders) — the latter remains multi-week.

### Reference-diff is FEASIBLE — turnkey starting point for next session
Confirmed the working build can serve as a correctness oracle for the init divergence:
- The prod game exe `out/build/linux-amd64-release/south_park_td` (20 MB, the rexglue-sdk recomp that
  renders this title fully) is **NOT stripped**: it exports all ~30,310 guest `sub_*` symbols, incl.
  `sub_821E07A0` (count loop) @ host 0x733910 (W), `sub_82244378` (XUI validator) @ 0x879d80,
  `sub_821DC228` (float dispatcher) @ 0000000000725a20. So I can break read-only at the exact guest
  functions that diverge in variant A.
- A display is available (DISPLAY=:0 / wayland-0) and launch is known (`tools/gamectl.sh`):
  `cd out/build/linux-amd64-release && SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./south_park_td
  --game_data_root=../../../private/extracted --user_data_root=../../../private/userdata
  --log_file=run.log`. ⚠ leaks a 4.5 GB /dev/shm/xenia_memory_* per launch — run `tools/gamectl.sh
  kill_all` after to reclaim it; NEVER modify the prod binary (read-only gdb only).
- Procedure: break sub_821DC228 in prod and read the loop index (max should be ≤21; variant A reaches
  32767 because the count is 0x8000) → confirms which side is correct; then break sub_821E07A0 /
  sub_82244378 entry in BOTH builds and diff the guest object state (the construction inputs) to find the
  first divergence. Caveat: the two builds use different PPCContext layouts + heap addresses, so compare
  GUEST values (registers/memory contents), match the same call instance, not host pointers.

This won't itself produce frames (the GPU engine — PM4 → Plume → 19 shaders — remains multi-week after
init is correct), but it is the lowest-cost route to unblock the CRT-init divergence that currently
stops the boot well before the GPU boundary.

### Reference diff is OPERATIONAL — first cross-build signal captured
Ran the working build read-only under gdb and confirmed the mechanics work:
- `cd out/build/linux-amd64-release && timeout N env SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. DISPLAY=:0
  gdb -batch -x <script> --args ./south_park_td --game_data_root=<abs> --user_data_root=<abs>
  --log_file=run.log --log_level=info`, then `tools/gamectl.sh kill_all` + `rm -f /dev/shm/xenia_memory_*`.
- The exe is **PIE** → break by SYMBOL (`break sub_821DC228`), NOT by the `nm` link-time address.
- Prod uses the **same XenonRecomp PPCContext layout** as variant A: at a `PPC_FUNC` breakpoint
  `rdi`=&ctx, `rsi`=base (prod base = `0x100000000`), and `ctx.rN.u32` reads as `*(uint*)(rdi+off)` with
  r3@0x00, r1@0x10, r4@0x20. So guest registers/memory are readable identically in both builds.

First signal: in ~70 s of gdb-slowed boot, **prod calls `sub_821DC228` ZERO times** (it entered
`sub_821E07A0` once, r3=0x40029140, with no dispatcher calls), whereas **variant A calls it 32768 times**
(count=0x8000). Strongly suggests variant A's float-store loop is spurious / runs with a bogus count.
⚠ CAVEAT before concluding: gdb-slowed prod may simply not have *reached* the same boot stage yet —
next step must confirm prod passes the equivalent point (e.g. video init / the `sub_82244378` XUI parse)
and STILL never loops, and match the same `sub_821E07A0` invocation (it can be called from several sites).
Then diff the loop-entry guard inputs / count source (`*(orig+144)+31`) between builds to find where
variant A's count first goes wrong. This capability now makes any divergent function comparable to the
known-good build in minutes.

### CONFIRMED via reference oracle: variant A's count loop is SPURIOUS
Ran the working build ~95 s under gdb (read-only): it entered `sub_821E07A0` exactly once, called the
float-store dispatcher `sub_821DC228` **zero times**, and **reached rendering** (run.log: "Created 54
graphics pipelines from Vulkan storage", VulkanTextureCache active). So the correct build renders without
ever executing that loop — variant A's 32768-iteration loop (count=0x8000) is definitively wrong, not a
boot-stage artifact. (Caveat resolved: prod did reach the render stage, so it's "never runs", not "not
yet".)

The divergence is therefore in `sub_821E07A0`'s ENTRY logic (ppc_recomp.19.cpp from line 2877): before
the loop it does several `PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC` virtual calls + branches —
`if(r8==0) goto loc_821E08B8` (2912), `if(*(r31+16)!=0) goto loc_821E08DC` (2920),
`if(r3<0) goto loc_821E08E0` (2937) — one of which, in the correct build, routes PAST the loop. Variant A
takes the loop path because one of those virtual-call results / branch inputs diverges. Next: capture
those branch inputs (r8 @2909, *(r31+16) @2917, the 2933 vcall's r3 @2935) in variant A, then find the
first one whose value is wrong vs the correct build — that pins the divergence. (Cross-build address
matching is confounded by different heap layouts + prod's different host code/no source lines, so compare
guest VALUES and branch decisions, matched by call order, not host pointers.)

This is the same object-data-corruption family as the XUI `+8` crash; pinning either root likely explains
both. Still upstream of the GPU engine (multi-week) — but the reference oracle makes the init root
attackable directly now.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — BREAKTHROUGH: one VFS fix unblocks all init; boot reaches the RENDER LOOP

The reference oracle paid off. Traced the count divergence to its true root: the title sizes its asset
reads with **NtQueryInformationFile / FILE_NETWORK_OPEN_INFORMATION (class 34)**, whose `EndOfFile` is at
**+40** (offsets 0..31 are timestamps, AllocationSize @+32). My impl wrote `EndOfFile` at **+8**
(FILE_STANDARD layout) for every non-position class, so class-34 size queries returned 0 → 0-byte reads
→ `SouthParkXact.xgs` ("FSGX") and `*.ptc` never loaded → the main object's `+144` pointed at garbage →
BOTH the spurious 32768-iter `sub_821E07A0` count loop AND the `sub_82244378` XUI-validation SIGSEGV.

Fix (commit 760b0bd, kernel.cpp): switch on `infoClass` — 14 (FilePositionInformation, CurrentByteOffset
@0), 34 (FileNetworkOpenInformation: times @0..31, AllocationSize @32, EndOfFile @40, FileAttributes @48),
5/default (FileStandardInformation: Alloc @0, EndOfFile @8, NumberOfLinks @16); report bytes-written in
the IoStatusBlock.

Result — one fix, the whole init chain unblocked:
- XGS reads 931 B, .ptc 93863 B (were 0); **INDIRECT-NULL 10347 → 0** (count loop gone);
  **the SIGSEGV at sub_82244378 is GONE** (exit 139 → 124/running).
- Boot now crosses video init: `VdInitializeRingBuffer(base=0xA0002000 size=0x1000)`,
  `VdEnableRingBufferRPtrWriteBack(ptr=0x201003C)`, **vblank pump started**,
  `VdSetGraphicsInterruptCallback(cb=0x821C7170)`, `XGetVideoMode 1280x720`, 6 threads, XexLoadImage.
- It then runs the title's **main/render loop** `sub_821CC5D0` (a per-frame critical-section acquire +
  `KeWaitForSingleObject`, ~34/s). NOT crashed, NOT deadlocked — but NOT yet presenting (`VdSwap` not
  reached): it's waiting at the GPU command-processor boundary.

FRONTIER (task #6, the GPU engine — the last step before frames):
- The title writes PM4 to the ring buffer @0xA0002000 and waits on RPtr writeback @0x201003C. The vblank
  pump fires the graphics-interrupt callback every 16 ms, but the render-wait still spins → next: a "null
  GPU" that advances RPtr to the title's WPtr (capture WPtr via the system command buffer / CP_RB_WPTR)
  so the render-wait releases and the title proceeds to issue/await draws; THEN PM4 → Plume Vulkan + the
  19 shaders for actual pixels. This last stage remains multi-week, but init is no longer the blocker.

Lesson worth keeping: a single wrong struct-field offset in one kernel HLE call masqueraded as a deep
"object-graph corruption" across two unrelated subsystems. The guest-level reference oracle (diffing
against the rendering build) is what cut through it — keep it as the first tool for any divergence.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — GPU engine: scope nailed down to a PM4 interpreter (the renderer = step 5)

Pushed task #6 from "null GPU" to a fully-specified implementation plan, and proved no shortcut exists.

State recap: assets load, the game boots to its render loop and writes a PM4 stream to the ring buffer
(@0xA0002000). Built+committed (d9b009d) a minimal CP in the vblank pump that polls CP_RB_WPTR
(GPU MMIO base 0x7FC80000, reg 0x1C5 @0x7FC80714), advances RPtr in CP_RB_RPTR (0x7FC80710) + the
write-back (g_rptrWriteBack @0x201003C), and fires the command-complete interrupt. VERIFIED RPtr=WPtr=25.

Proven dead ends (so the next session doesn't repeat them):
- Advancing RPtr does NOT release the render-wait (event 0x36E70) — it isn't RPtr-gated.
- Firing the graphics-interrupt callback with source=1 alone does NOT release it (correctly ignored
  without backing GPU state).
- VdVerifyMEInitCommand is NOT called by the title — no stub-level shortcut.
- A KeSetEvent trace shows the title signals NEARBY render-context events (0x36e30, 0x36e54) but never
  0x36E70 — the 0x36E70 signal path is gated on the GPU actually PROCESSING the submitted PM4.

PM4 decoded: first packet 0xC0114800 = TYPE-3 op 0x48 = PM4_ME_INIT (count 17 → dwords 0..17), then
dwords 18..24 are the follow-on packet(s) to decode. So the render-wait needs a real PM4 interpreter.

IMPLEMENTATION SPEC (from rexglue-sdk src/graphics/command_processor.cpp — Xenia 1:1, already renders
this title; strongly prefer REUSING it over a scratch rewrite):
- CP worker loop: read write_ptr_index; if RPtr==WPtr (or 0xBAADF00D) wait; else
  read_ptr = ExecutePrimaryBuffer(read_ptr, write_ptr); store_and_swap RPtr to the write-back. (:290-53)
- ExecutePacket dispatch on `packet >> 30`: type 0 = ExecutePacketType0 (register-window writes),
  type 1/2 (rare/NOP), type 3 = ExecutePacketType3 (opcode = (packet>>8)&0x7F, count = ((packet>>16)&
  0x3FFF)+1). (:818-837)
- ME_INIT handler = ExecutePacketType3_ME_INIT (:1082) sets the CP micro-engine register bases.
- The render-wait ack is almost certainly a later packet: an EVENT_WRITE / interrupt-trigger that the
  CP turns into a memory write or graphics interrupt → the title's handler then signals 0x36E70. Decode
  dwords 18..24 + find that opcode; reproduce its side effect to release the wait (init-only, still no
  pixels). PIXELS then require the type-3 draw packets → Plume Vulkan + the 19 shaders
  (private/extracted/media/shaders/*.updb). Wire the CP to variant A's g_base / ring @0xA0002000 /
  regs @0x7FC80000 / RPtr-WB @0x201003C. This is the multi-week remainder; every other subsystem boots.

### Ring-buffer command structure fully decoded (completes the PM4-interpreter spec)
The 25-dword primary ring buffer @0xA0002000 is: PM4_ME_INIT (op 0x48, dwords 0..18) + TWO
PM4_INDIRECT_BUFFER packets (op 0x3F, confirmed vs command_processor.cpp:905/937 ExecutePacketType3_
INDIRECT_BUFFER:1200), each [IB_address, IB_size_dwords]: IB#1 @0x00090040 size 0x0B, IB#2 @0x00010000
size 0x40. ⇒ the REAL init/draw commands (and the ack that signals render-wait 0x36E70) are inside the
INDIRECT BUFFERS, not the primary ring. So the interpreter MUST recurse into IBs (read PM4 at IB_address
for IB_size dwords) — a plain primary-buffer walk won't see the commands. Implementation order for the
GPU engine: (1) primary-buffer walk RPtr→WPtr dispatch on packet>>30; (2) type-3 INDIRECT_BUFFER →
recurse; (3) ME_INIT + type-0 register-window writes (into the 0x7FC80000 reg file); (4) find the
EVENT_WRITE/interrupt opcode in the IBs that the title's handler turns into the KeSetEvent(0x36E70) ack,
reproduce it → render-wait releases (init done, still no pixels); (5) type-3 DRAW_* packets → Plume
Vulkan + 19 shaders → pixels. Best path remains reusing rexglue-sdk command_processor.cpp wholesale
(it already does 1-5 for this title) wired to variant A's g_base/ring/regs/RPtr-WB. Multi-week.

### Render-wait 0x36E70 — ALL bounded shortcuts exhausted; it requires real PM4 execution (confirmed)
Drove the render-wait release condition to ground. The main thread blocks on event 0x36E70; it is NOT
released by any of these (each tested/analyzed):
1. RPtr advance to WPtr (CP_RB_RPTR + write-back) — verified RPtr=WPtr=25, no release.
2. Graphics-interrupt callback source=1 (command-complete) — runs, no release.
3. VdVerifyMEInitCommand — the title never calls it (no stub shortcut).
4. Per-processor interrupt delivery — REFUTED: FillKPcr zeros the KPCR so every thread is processor 0;
   the callback (reads KPCR+0x10C) always acts as proc 0 and signals proc-0 events 0x36e30/0x36e54, NOT
   0x36E70. Callback args are correct (r3=source, r4=interrupt_callback_data_, matching rexglue
   DispatchInterruptCallback args[]={source, interrupt_callback_data_}).
⇒ 0x36E70 is the GPU **command-completion** event: the title submits PM4 (ME_INIT + 2 INDIRECT_BUFFER,
empty so far — it's awaiting CP-ready before filling the real-command IBs) and waits for the GPU to
EXECUTE it and write a completion fence/EOP that the title's code turns into KeSetEvent(0x36E70). With no
PM4 interpreter, that never happens. There is no stub/register/interrupt shortcut — only a real command
processor releases it.

DEFINITIVE: step 5 (renderer) == implement/integrate the GPU command processor (PM4 interpreter w/ IB
recursion + GPU memory model + EOP/fence + Plume Vulkan + 19 shaders). Reuse rexglue-sdk
command_processor.cpp. This is the multi-week remainder; every other subsystem boots and the game runs to
the point of submitting GPU work. Nothing further in this layer is a quick fix — confirmed exhaustively.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — GPU CP built: register-seed unlock + real PM4 interpreter; main thread advances; hit the GPU-init teardown

Two committed advances (6d85089, f6affa2), both verified via gdb. The boot moved from "stuck at the
early GPU spin" to "executing the real PM4 stream and walking the multi-stage GPU-init handshake."

### Fix A — seed the GPU registers prod's ReadRegister returns (commit 6d85089)
ROOT (found via the recompiled graphics-interrupt callback sub_821C7170 + the reference impl): variant
A's GPU register window 0x7FC80000 is **plain guest memory with no MMIO read interception**, so it read
0 everywhere. But rexglue `GraphicsSystem::ReadRegister` (graphics_system.cpp:241) returns specific
non-zero values for several registers the title polls. The decisive one is **reg 0x1951 (interrupt
status) @ mem 0x7FC86544**: the callback's vblank path does `lwz r11,25924(0x7FC80000); clrlwi. r11,31;
beq <skip>` — i.e. it SKIPS the whole vblank handler `sub_821BF748` unless bit 0 is set. Prod hardcodes
`ReadRegister(0x1951)==1`. Left 0 ⇒ the vblank handler never ran ⇒ the title stalled at the early GPU-init
wait. FIX: `InitGpuRegisters()` pre-seeds 0x0F00=0x08100748, 0x0F01=0x200E, 0x194C=720, 0x1951=1,
0x1961=(1280<<16|720) (1:1 with ReadRegister's switch); re-assert 0x1951=1 each vblank; deliver the
interrupt on **cpu 2** (KPCR+0x10C, matching prod `MarkVblank → DispatchInterruptCallback(0,2)`). RESULT:
boot crossed the `KeGetCurrentProcessType` spin (753→7 hits) through XAudioRegisterRenderDriverClient +
the 23.5MB UI.xzp load to the deeper render-loop waits. **Main thread reached the exact chain the task
named**: `_xstart→…→sub_822E2CF0→sub_822F2CE0→sub_8230F368→sub_8230F098→KeWaitForSingleObject(0x36E30,∞)`.

### Fix B — real PM4 command-processor interpreter (commit f6affa2)
Replaced the null-GPU blind RPtr advance with an actual interpreter in kernel.cpp (ExecutePM4 /
ExecuteType3 / ExecuteRing), structured 1:1 with rexglue command_processor.cpp. The pump, when WPTR
advances, runs ExecuteRing(lastWptr, wptr) under the coop token, then advances RPtr.
- **ADDRESS MODEL (verified, the key detail):** variant A's flat 4 GiB map puts "physical" GPU memory
  (MmAllocatePhysicalMemoryEx, the ring, the IBs) in the **0xA0000000 window**. The PM4 carries physical
  addresses with mirror bits stripped (e.g. IB addr 0x90040), so `TranslatePhys(p) = 0xA0000000 | (p &
  0x1FFFFFFF)`. PROVEN by dumping: IB#1 phys 0x90040 → guest **0xA0090040** holds real PM4 (a
  WAIT_REG_MEM packet), while raw 0x90040 is zero; IB#2 0x10000 → **0xA0010000** holds PM4, raw 0x10000
  holds UTF-16 text. ring base 0xA0002000 is self-consistent (TranslatePhys(0xA0002000)=0xA0002000).
- Ring decode (WPTR=25 dwords): `C0114800`=ME_INIT(0x48,count18) + `C0013F00`=INDIRECT_BUFFER(0x3F)→
  [0x90040,len11] + INDIRECT_BUFFER→[0x10000,len64]. PM4 opcodes from xenos.h (note PM4_INTERRUPT=0x54,
  XE_SWAP=0x64). Handlers: type-0/1 reg writes → 0x7FC80000 window; ME_INIT/NOP/SET_CONSTANT/WAIT_REG_MEM
  skipped; INDIRECT_BUFFER recurses (depth-guarded); EVENT_WRITE_SHD writes the fence value (GST32 = BE,
  k8in32) the guest polls; INTERRUPT fires the gfx callback per cpu-bit; DRAW_INDX/2 + XE_SWAP counted.
- VERIFIED RUN (REX_CPTRACE=1): executes the init batch, recurses IB#2 into 3 nested IBs (0xA2014000 /
  0xA2014D40 / 0xA2015980), writes 2 fences (0xA2010000=0x3, 0xA2010004=0xA00100D4). **The fence
  side-effects advanced the main thread past 0x36E30 to the next GPU-completion wait 0x388C4** (231620).
  REX_EVTRACE confirms: 0x36E30/0x36E54/0x388C4/0x388E8 each signaled once; 0x29CD4 waited 1314×, never
  signaled.

### CURRENT FRONTIER (precise, resume here) — the GPU-device TEARDOWN after init
After the interpreter executes the init batch, a **worker thread tears down the whole GPU device**.
Pinpointed with a hardware watchpoint on device+10900 (device = g_interruptData = 0x26F80):
1. `sub_821C73D8(device, config=0x828C1298)` builds the device (lr=0x821C7FFC, in sub_821C7F08): allocs
   cmdbuf1=**0xA0002000 (THE RING)**, cmdbuf2=0xA0010000, blk96 @device+10896=0xA2010000 (the GPU
   identifier/fence block, set by VdSetSystemCommandBufferGpuIdentifierAddress — a no-op in both builds),
   handler-block @device+10900=0xA2011000 (the command-complete handler block read by callback source==1).
2. Then a worker (`sub_8214F730→sub_8214F738→sub_822A2158→sub_822A7C08→sub_822A58F8`) memsets 16 buffers
   (sub_8242BF10 = memset), **zeroing device+10900, +10896, +15044(cmdbuf1 ptr), +15048(cmdbuf2 ptr) all
   to 0**. The ring @0xA0002000 still holds ME_INIT, but the device's buffer pointers are wiped.
3. STUCK STATE: main thread waits 0x388C4 (∞); render workers `sub_821CC5D0` wait 0x29CD4 (30ms poll) /
   0x29D40 (∞) — these GPU-completion events are NEVER signaled. The command-complete callback path
   (sub_821C7170 source==1) can't help because device+10900 is now 0.

INTERPRETATION (hypothesis, NOT yet proven): the title sets up the GPU, the init handshake isn't
satisfied by the CP, and a worker tears the device down (or it's a normal "free temp init buffers" step
the title can't progress past because the next phase's completion never arrives). The teardown is guest
code (a worker task sub_822A2158, 6 args), reached only BECAUSE the interpreter advanced the title there
— it is not interpreter-caused corruption (it's a guest memset of guest buffers).

### NEXT STEPS (in priority order)
1. **Root-cause the teardown / handshake.** Trace what makes the worker run sub_822A2158 and whether it's
   gated on a fence/identifier value at the GPU id block (0xA2010000 region) or a register — i.e. what
   "GPU init succeeded" signal the CP must produce. Watchpoint device+15044 / the id block; diff vs the
   reference oracle (prod renders, so its worker either doesn't tear down or re-inits). ⚠ prod is Release
   (no ctx symbols) — read its guest memory via its membase + break by guest symbol.
2. **Verify the EVENT_WRITE_SHD fence semantics** the render workers (0x29CD4/0x29D40) actually poll —
   they may need a counter fence (is_counter) tied to XE_SWAP, or a specific value the nested IBs request.
3. Once init completes and the title submits frames (WPTR advances repeatedly, XE_SWAP fires): wire
   DRAW_INDX/DRAW_INDX_2 → Plume Vulkan + the 19 shaders (private/extracted/media/shaders/*.updb), crib
   Unleashed gpu/video.cpp. = the multi-week render remainder.

TOOLING: REX_CPTRACE=1 (PM4 packet trace), REX_EVTRACE=1 (event signal/wait count maps g_evSignalCount/
g_evWaitCount, readable via gdb `p '(anonymous namespace)::g_evSignalCount'`). gdb scripts in /tmp:
dumpring.gdb (ring+IB dump), threads_va.gdb (thread dump), watch_teardown.gdb (the teardown watchpoint),
verify_dev.gdb (device-buffer state). Attach to the BINARY pid (filter /proc/PID/comm; pgrep -f also
matches the shell wrapper). Reading guest memory under attach is safe; live ctx stepping fights the token.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — TEARDOWN ROOT-CAUSED: it is guest-heap memory corruption (NOT a GPU-init handshake)

Drove the "GPU-device teardown" to ground with the reference oracle + watchpoints. The teardown is
**memory corruption from a guest-heap double-allocation**, surfaced (not caused) by the PM4 interpreter
advancing the title into ArcadeLogo.ptc resource processing.

THE MECHANISM (all gdb-verified):
- A worker runs `sub_8214F738` which opens `game:\media\ArcadeLogo.ptc` (variant A handle 0xF2000002)
  and processes it: `sub_822A2158 → sub_822A7C08 → sub_822A58F8`, which does **16 memcpys** (sub_8242BF10)
  of the .ptc data (src in the .ptc load buffer ~0x5C5xx) into a resource buffer whose base is **0x262B0**
  (a ~16 KB buffer: dst = base + r26, r26 ∈ {0,0x400,0x1400,0x2800,...}).
- That buffer **overlaps the live GPU device struct at 0x26F80** (device spans 0x26F80..~0x2AA48; the
  copies hit 0x276B0/0x28AB0/0x29EB0/0x2A2B0 and a watchpoint caught device+10900 (0x29A14) being set 0).
  So loading the .ptc OVERWRITES the device — zeroing +10900 (cmd-complete handler block), +10896 (GPU id
  block), +15044 (cmdbuf1/ring ptr), +15048 (cmdbuf2). That is the "teardown".
- Corrupting the device is why the downstream GPU-completion waits never release (events 0x29CD4/0x29D40
  in the device, 0x388C4 in the thread pool — main thread + render workers sub_821CC5D0 stall).

REFERENCE-ORACLE COMPARISON (corrected — earlier "prod never calls sub_822A2158" was breakpoint-
interference that segv'd prod; with a single breakpoint prod calls it **1×** and renders 55 pipelines):
- Both prod AND variant A run the .ptc copy (`sub_822A2158`) — it is NORMAL processing, not error-recovery.
- The divergence is PLACEMENT: prod's heap puts the .ptc buffer where it does NOT hit the device; variant
  A's heap puts it OVERLAPPING the device.
- prod's device is at **0x40016F80**; variant A's at **0x26F80** — both = `heap_base + 0x16F80`, but the
  title heap base differs: prod 0x40000000, variant A 0x10000 (from `NtAllocateVirtualMemory req=0
  sz=0x100000 → base=0x10000`, a 1 MB reserve; device + .ptc buffer are both sub-allocs inside it).
  (prod device addr read from its log: `[gpu] SetInterruptCallback(821C7170, 40016F80)`.)

⇒ ROOT: **variant A's guest heap (RtlAllocateHeap, sub_82448090; heap created by RtlCreateHeap
sub_8244B380) double-allocates** — it hands out 0x262B0 for a 16 KB .ptc buffer while the device is live
at 0x26F80. The heap's free-list is in a different state than prod's (the device's range isn't treated as
in-use, or an earlier alloc/free diverged). Same CLASS as the original systemic NtQueryInformationFile
bug: a subtle kernel-HLE/data divergence corrupting the title's own structures.

NEXT STEPS (the fix):
1. Find the heap-state divergence. Prime suspects: the heap-backing kernel HLE — `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`
   / `NtFreeVirtualMemory` / `NtQueryVirtualMemory` semantics feeding RtlCreateHeap (sub_8244B380) wrong
   region info (e.g. a wrong returned size/base so the heap mis-tracks free space), or a heap-block-header
   field computed wrong. Watchpoint the device allocation (who allocates 0x26F80, is its range recorded?)
   and the 0x262B0 allocation; diff the heap free-list vs the prod oracle (guest-level diff — the technique
   that found the systemic bug).
2. This is independent of the GPU CP (the CP writes only 0xA0000000+/0x7FC80000); the CP just advanced the
   boot far enough to surface it. Once the heap stops corrupting the device, re-evaluate the GPU-completion
   waits (they may then be satisfiable by the interpreter's fences/interrupts) → VdSwap → DRAW → Vulkan.

TOOLING added: REX_EVTRACE now records per-event signaler/waiter guest LRs (g_evSignalLR/g_evWaitLR) —
this is how the thread-pool producers/consumers were identified (signaler sub_8230E898, waiter
sub_8230F098). gdb scripts /tmp/{collide,watch_teardown,openchk,prod_f738,prod_a2158}.gdb.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — allocation diff: the teardown is a guest-heap free-list divergence (both device & .ptc buffer from sub_82448090)

Ran the allocation-sequence diff (option a). Findings (gdb watchpoints from the guest entry):
- **The device (0x26F80) is allocated by the GUEST HEAP allocator sub_82448090**, via the main-thread
  graphics init: `_xstart → … → sub_8212DBA0 → sub_821C7F08 → sub_821D7438` (sub_8212DBA0 calls
  sub_82448090 at :21083/:21136, then sub_821C7F08(device) at :21170; sub_821D7438 writes the device's
  first field = 0xFFFFFFFF).
- **The colliding .ptc buffer (0x262B0) is ALSO a sub_82448090 allocation**, via the worker:
  `sub_8214F730 → sub_8214F738 → sub_821BE840` (sub_821BE840 calls sub_82448090 ×3 at :8820/:8883/:8910).
  Watchpoints confirm 0x262B0 is NEVER written before the .ptc data lands (no separate zeroing), i.e. it is
  a fresh heap block whose header sits just below the watched word.
- ⇒ **Both come from the SAME guest heap (sub_82448090).** The device is allocated EARLY (heap+0x16F80);
  the .ptc buffer is allocated LATER but at a LOWER offset (heap+0x162B0) — so the heap is reusing a freed
  region, and that reused 16 KB block overlaps the live 15 KB device. The heap's **free-list tracks a free
  block at heap+0x162B0 of ≥16 KB that overlaps the live device at heap+0x16F80** — a free-list divergence.
- sub_82448090 is the SAME recompiled code in prod, so it can't misbehave on identical inputs ⇒ the
  divergence is the heap STATE: an earlier alloc/free in variant A differs from prod, leaving the free-list
  with a block overlapping the device. (heap base also differs: variant A 0x10000 vs prod 0x40000000, both
  device = base+0x16F80 — but the collision is relative/free-list, not just the base.)

REMAINING (the true root): diff the **full guest-heap alloc/free sequence** between the device allocation
and the .ptc-buffer allocation, variant A vs prod, to find the one operation that diverges (the bad
free/coalesce that leaves heap+0x162B0 free over the live device). Candidate tools: break sub_82448090 +
the heap's free (RtlFreeHeap) and log (size, ptr, caller) into a per-build trace, then diff. ⚠ prod is
Release (read guest mem by membase, break by symbol; can't read ctx). gdb: /tmp/{earlyalloc,devalloc2,
allochist}.gdb (watch a guest addr from __imp___xstart, walk the writers).

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — teardown refined: device = one 24KB heap block; .ptc main buffers are CORRECT; corruption = a subset of wrong dest pointers

Deeper allocation diff:
- **The device is ONE 24 KB guest-heap block.** sub_8212DBA0 calls sub_82448090(size=24448=0x5F80) →
  0x26F40 (caller 0x8212DCEC); the device struct is `(0x26F40+131)&~0x7F = 0x26F80` (alloc aligned up
  128B; orig ptr saved at device-4), then memset to 24320 (0x5F00) → device spans 0x26F80..0x2CE80.
- **sub_821BE840's main .ptc buffers are CORRECT** — allocated in the 0xA0000000 physical window:
  a1 size 0x500 (small obj), a2 size **0x398000 (3.7 MB) → 0xA2016000 / 0xA23AE000**, a3 size 0x21E800 →
  0xA2746000. So the .ptc loader's big vertex/texture buffers are placed FINE (no device overlap).
- ⇒ The corruption is NOT a gross allocator failure. It's a **subset of destination pointers** in the
  16-entry buffer-ptr array that sub_822A58F8 walks (r28 = *(r1+1412)+60, where *(r1+1412)=0x20F50A98):
  most entries point to the correct 0xA2xxxxxx buffers, but SOME point INTO the device struct (bases
  0x262B0 / 0x29EB0 → writes land at device+0x770..+0x3370, hitting device+10900 the handler-block ptr).
- Still a variant-A divergence (prod renders); the device block alloc + the physical buffers are identical
  in spirit to prod, so the wrong array entries are the divergence.

REMAINING ROOT (next layer): who populates the buffer-ptr array at 0x20F50A98+60 with device-pointing
entries (0x262B0/0x29EB0)? Trace the writers of that array; determine whether *(r1+1412)=0x20F50A98 is a
valid structure or a wild pointer, and where the device-pointing entries come from (a .ptc-relocation base,
a stride/count parsed wrong, or a stale/garbage pointer). This is the .ptc-loader's vertex-stream
descriptor — several functions deep (sub_822A2158/sub_822A7C08/sub_822A7480/sub_822AC488/sub_822AC328).

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — ROOT FOUND: .ptc vertex-stream destinations are UN-RELOCATED (missing the buffer base) → overwrite the device

Pinpointed the exact corrupting write with a targeted break (sub_822A58F8:8757, condition: the memcpy
whose [dst,dst+size) covers device+10900=0x29A14). Captured:
  dst=0x296B0 base(r11)=0x262B0 off(r26)=0x3400 src=0x5C560 size=0x400
  buffer-ptr array (16 entries) = 0x82B0, 0xBEB0, 0xFAB0, ... 0x262B0(#8), 0x29EB0(#9), ... 0x406B0
i.e. **array[i] = 0x82B0 + i*0x3C00** (16 stream buffers, stride 0x3C00=15360, built by the loop at
sub_822A58F8 loc_822A5E70: `r10 += r9; *(r11+=4)=r10`). dst = array[i] + r26.

THE BUG: these destination bases are **raw offsets (0x82B0 + i*0x3C00 = 0x82B0..0x442B0)** — they are
MISSING the real buffer base. sub_821BE840 ALLOCATED the real .ptc buffers at **0xA2016000** (3.7 MB,
0x398000); the 16 stream offsets (240 KB total) fit inside it, so the destinations SHOULD be
`0xA2016000 + (0x82B0 + i*0x3C00)`. Instead they are just `0x82B0 + i*0x3C00`, which lands in low memory
(0x82B0) through the title heap — straddling the **device block at 0x26F40** (entries #8/#9 = 0x262B0 /
0x29EB0 fall in the device), so the .ptc stream copy overwrites the device (incl. +10900 the handler ptr).

⇒ The .ptc vertex-stream destination computation fails to RELOCATE the stream offsets onto the allocated
buffer base — a missing/zero base. Since the recompiled guest code is identical to prod, the divergence is
a DATA value: the field that should carry the buffer base (0xA2016000) reads 0 (or the wrong field) when
the stream-destination array is built, leaving raw offsets. Same CLASS as the NtQueryInformationFile
systemic bug (a wrong field value, not codegen).

NEXT (the fix): find where sub_822A58F8 / sub_822A7C08 reads the per-stream buffer base for the array
build (the initial r10 / the source of 0x82B0). Determine which object field should hold 0xA2016000 but
reads 0 in variant A, and trace upstream to where sub_821BE840 stores its allocated buffer ptr into the
.ptc object — a field-offset / store divergence. Fix that store/read so the stream destinations relocate
onto 0xA2016000 → no device overwrite → re-test the GPU-completion waits.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — ⛔ PRIOR ROOT-CAUSE CORRECTED: it is a HEAP FREE-LIST corruption, NOT un-relocated .ptc offsets

The "ROOT FOUND: .ptc vertex-stream destinations are un-relocated" conclusion ABOVE is **WRONG** (it
assumed the dest array held raw offsets that should add a buffer base 0xA2016000). Drove it to ground with
gdb (scripts /tmp/{capture,relo,entry,alloc,site,trace,heaplog,heapdump,heapfl,narrow2,watchfl}.gdb) and
found the real mechanism:

THE DEST BASE *(obj+192) IS AN ALLOCATOR RETURN, NOT A FILE OFFSET. The .ptc stream-dest array
(`sub_822A7C08` builds `array[i] = *(obj+192) + i*stride` on its stack at r1+128; `sub_822A58F8` consumes
it as the r7 arg) gets its base from `sub_822A8150` (called at sub_822A2158:23167, right before
sub_822A7C08), which **allocates the stream buffer**: `sub_82448090(size=0x78000, flags=0x24870000)` →
stored at obj+192. gdb trace (/tmp/trace.gdb) caught it: that alloc **returns 0x82B0** — an address BELOW
the title heap base (0x10000), spanning the live GPU device at 0x26F40. So `*(obj+192)=0x82B0` is the
**allocator's bogus return**, not a missing relocation. (The object IS a stack struct in sub_822A2158's
frame, ~0x980AF7B0 because worker stacks live in the 0x98000000 region; +0 holds the "PTC+" magic copied
from the file header, which misled the prior session into the file-offset theory.)

THE ALLOCATOR PATH: `sub_82448090(sz,flags)` routes by flag bit0. flags 0x24870000 → bit0 clear →
`sub_8244DF68(0,sz)` → `sub_8244CDF0` (returns the single global heap handle = `*(0x82902448)` = 0x10000)
→ `sub_8244B950` (the NT classic heap allocator; heap signature 0xEEFFEEFF at heap+0x10). The 0x78000
request (480 KB) → index 0x7800; heap+0x28 VirtualMemoryThreshold = 0xF000, so 0x7800 < threshold ⇒ the
**free-list[0] large-block search** (loc_8244BBFC→loc_8244BC08), NOT the virtual-alloc path (loc_8244C08C
base=0) and NOT the extend helper sub_8244ADD8 (verified absent from the bt).

THE CORRUPT BLOCK (the smoking gun, /tmp/narrow2.gdb — break sub_8244B950 ppc_recomp.65.cpp:7704 when
ctx.r3.u32 in [0x1000,0x10000)): the free-list[0] walk SELECTS a fabricated block at **r3=0x82A0**
(= heapbase 0x10000 − 0x7D60), header (BE u32): `+0=0x80000000` (size field 0x8000 *16-byte* units =
0x80000 B ≥ the 0x78000 request, so the walk accepts it), `+4=0x00100000` (looks like the heap reserve
size), `+8=0x00010180` (Flink = the free-list[0] sentinel heap+0x180), `+0xC=0x000582A8` (Blink → **into
the .ptc file-load buffer region**: file buf = 0x50000 (NtAllocate req=0x50000 sz=0x20000), and
0x582A8 = 0x50000+0x82A8). So **free-list[0] is corrupted with a phantom large free block below the heap
base whose link points into the .ptc file buffer**; the 0x78000 alloc reuses it → dst array
0x82B0+i*0x3C00 → entries #8/#9 (0x262B0/0x29EB0) land in the device → device+10900 zeroed → GPU-completion
waits (main 0x388C4; render workers 0x29CD4/0x29D40) never release.

BASE-INDEPENDENT (so NOT a layout fix): tested g_virtNext bump base 0x10000 → bad block 0x82B0;
0x40000000 (prod's; the title heap then lands at prod's exact place — device struct = **0x40016F80**, the
address prod logs in `SetInterruptCallback(821C7170, 40016F80)`) → bad block **0x3FFF82B0 = base−0x7D50,
STILL spanning the device**. Reverted the base to 0x10000 (the deliberate choice so the title's big
low-memory reserve stays below the image). The device landing at prod's EXACT address with base
0x40000000 proves variant A's heap is in sync with prod up to the device — so the divergence is purely in
the large-alloc free-list state AFTER the device alloc.

⇒ TRUE ROOT (open): a guest-heap free/coalesce produces a phantom free block below the heap base, linked
into free-list[0], with a Blink into the .ptc file buffer. Same CLASS as the systemic
NtQueryInformationFile bug (a value/state divergence, not codegen) — but now localized to the heap. Prime
suspects: (a) a XenonRecomp emitter mis-translation in the heap free/coalesce path (sub_82448128 /
RtlFreeHeap and its backward-coalesce via a block's PreviousSize — prod uses the *rexglue* recompiler, so
a variant-A-only emitter bug here would diverge), or (b) variant A's NtAllocateVirtualMemory/
NtQueryVirtualMemory commit semantics (variant A tracks ONE VRegion per reserve and reports whole-region
commit state, not per-page — the heap may mis-track its committed/uncommitted ranges and coalesce wrong).

NEXT EXPERIMENT (precise): the corrupt block is linked MID-CHAIN (a watchpoint on just the free-list[0]
sentinel heap+0x184 did NOT catch it). Catch the corrupting insertion by (1) watching a WIDER window —
the whole free-list[0] LIST_ENTRY plus the phantom block's eventual location — or instrument RtlFreeHeap
(sub_82448128) + the coalesce to log every (block, size, prev-size, new free-list links) and flag the
first below-heap link, with the guest LR; OR (2) PROD-DIFF: prod uses the SAME `__imp__sub_XXX` ABI and
HAS the heap symbols (nm out/build/linux-amd64-release/south_park_td: sub_82448090/sub_8244B950/
sub_8244DF68) — log the heap op sequence (alloc/free sizes+results, relative to heap base) in both and
find the first divergent op after the device alloc. ⚠ prod is Release (no readable ctx) → read its guest
mem via membase / few breakpoints (hot heap funcs crash prod). Once the corrupting op is found, fix the
HLE/emitter divergence → the 0x78000 alloc lands in valid heap space → device uncorrupted → re-test the
GPU-completion waits → VdSwap → DRAW. Tools added this session: /tmp/trace.gdb (path through sub_822A8150),
/tmp/narrow2.gdb (catch the below-heap block + header + bt), /tmp/heaplog.gdb (alloc size/flags/result map),
/tmp/heapdump.gdb (heap struct dump). kernel.cpp:78 has an inline NOTE summarizing this.

### DEEPER (same session) — the phantom block is created by the heap EXTEND committing AT THE SEGMENT BASE
Drove it one layer further (gdb /tmp/{watch82a0,narrow3}.gdb). The free-list[0] walk had NO fit for the
0x78000 request, so it took the EXTEND path: sub_8244B950:7671 (loc_8244BC64) -> sub_8244ADD8 ->
sub_82449E78 (commit pages) -> sub_8244A108 (create/coalesce the new block). Caught at sub_8244A108:1882:
the new block r4 = 0x10000 -- the HEAP BASE / segment itself. sub_8244A108 wrote a fresh _HEAP_ENTRY at
0x10000 (overwriting the heap's own header: was Size=0x64/PrevSize=0 per heapdump, became 0x800007D6 =
Size=0x8000, PreviousSize=0x7D6), then its backward-coalesce did r31 = r4 - PreviousSize*16 = 0x10000 -
0x7D60 = 0x82A0 (the phantom block, below the base). Chain: extend commits the new block AT THE SEGMENT
BASE -> overwrites the heap header -> coalesce reads the just-written garbage PrevSize=0x7D6 -> underflows
to 0x82A0 -> free-list[0] gets the below-base phantom -> 0x78000 alloc reuses it -> device overwrite.

WHY commit at the base: sub_82449E78 walks the segment's UnCommittedRanges list (head = *(segment+56)) and
commits at the found range's address (*(range+4)); for the heap's first segment (0x10000) that address is
0x10000 (the base) -- the segment thinks it is UNCOMMITTED FROM THE BASE, ignoring the initial header commit
(early log: NtAllocate req=0x10000 sz=0x10000 COMMIT committed 0x10000..0x20000) and the early in-place
allocs (device 0x26F40 etc. landed correctly, so the FREE-LIST was fine -- only the segment's
UnCommittedRanges / commit-boundary is wrong). Boot log confirms the extend commit: NtAllocate req=0x10000
sz=0x80000 COMMIT -> 0x10000 (commits over the live header/device region).

=> DEEPEST ROOT (open): the heap segment's UnCommittedRanges (*(segment+56)) wrongly says uncommitted starts
at the segment base. Set at heap creation (RtlCreateHeap = sub_8244B380, ppc_recomp.65.cpp:4569) and
maintained by RtlpFindAndCommitPages. Likely a variant-A divergence in how the commit-tracking is
seeded/updated vs prod (XenonRecomp emitter bug in the segment/UCR bookkeeping, OR variant A's
NtAllocateVirtualMemory COMMIT return/semantics so the initial-commit does not shrink the UCR). NEXT: read
sub_8244B380's segment/UnCommittedRanges setup + capture *(segment+56) and *(range+4) at the extend; compare
with prod (same __imp__sub_XXX symbols).

ATTEMPTED FIX (kept, but NOT the cure): added zero-on-decommit/release to NtFreeVirtualMemory (real NT/Xbox
MEM_DECOMMIT loses page contents). Correct semantics + verified not to break early boot, but does NOT fix
this bug -- the garbage PrevSize comes from the extend overwriting the LIVE heap header at the base, not from
stale decommitted data. Left in as a correctness improvement.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — ✅ FIXED: the corruption was the NtFreeVirtualMemory(MEM_DECOMMIT) WRITEBACK (commit 4e011b5)
The "DEEPEST ROOT (open)" above (segment UnCommittedRanges says uncommitted-from-base) is now ROOT-CAUSED and
FIXED. It was an HLE bug in our kernel, NOT an emitter bug and NOT heap-create UCR seeding.

THE CONCRETE SEQUENCE (KTRACE with caller-LR added to Nt{Allocate,Free}VirtualMemory — that is what made it
diagnosable; see the title-heap 0x10000 reserve [0x10000,0x110000)):
- Heap grows commit CORRECTLY, advancing the boundary: NtAllocate COMMIT req=0x20000,0x30000,0x40000,0x50000,
  0x60000 -> committed to 0x80000 (all from lr=0x82449F30 = RtlpFindAndCommitPages sub_82449E78). The device
  (0x26F80) lands in this correctly-committed region. So the UCR was FINE up to here (refutes the earlier
  "set wrong at RtlCreateHeap" guess).
- Then the heap SHRINKS: NtFreeVirtualMemory(MEM_DECOMMIT, req=0x70000, reqsz=0x10000) from lr=0x8244B140
  (RtlpDeCommitFreeBlock sub_8244B018) -- decommit the file-buffer tail [0x70000,0x80000).
- ⚠ Our NtFreeVirtualMemory wrote the out-params back as the WHOLE reservation: *BaseAddress=rb=0x10000,
  *RegionSize=r->size=0x100000 (instead of the page-aligned requested sub-range 0x70000 / 0x10000).
- The guest decommit helper READS *BaseAddress / *RegionSize BACK (sub_8244B018: ppc_recomp.65.cpp:4184-4190
  `lwz r5,80(r1); lwz r4,84(r1); bl 0x82449d58`) and feeds them to sub_82449D58, which INSERTS [base,size)
  into the segment's UnCommittedRanges. So the heap recorded the ENTIRE reservation [0x10000,0x110000) as
  uncommitted -> UCR first-range addr reset to 0x10000.
- Next extend (the 0x78000 .ptc vertex-stream buffer): RtlpFindAndCommitPages walks the UCR, finds the
  [0x10000,...) range, and commits AT THE BASE: NtAllocate COMMIT req=0x10000 sz=0x80000 -> commits
  [0x10000,0x90000), over the live header + device. sub_8244A108 writes a fresh _HEAP_ENTRY at 0x10000
  (0x800007D6 = Size 0x8000 / PrevSize 0x7D6); backward-coalesce r31 = 0x10000 - 0x7D60 = 0x82A0 (the phantom
  below-base block). device+10900 zeroed -> all GPU-completion waits (main 0x388C4; render 0x29CD4/0x29D40)
  stall = the "teardown".

THE FIX (kernel.cpp NtFreeVirtualMemory): MEM_DECOMMIT now writes back the page-aligned requested base and the
page-rounded requested size, and only clears the region's committed flag when the WHOLE reservation is
decommitted; MEM_RELEASE still returns the whole allocation. (The prior zero-on-decommit was necessary-but-
not-sufficient; the writeback was the actual divergence — prod's rexglue kernel returns the sub-range, ours
returned the region.)

RESULT (verified, 4 runs, deterministic 462-463 lines): the post-decommit commit lands clear of the device
(NtAllocate COMMIT req=0x70000 then 0x80000, NEVER req=0x10000 sz=0x80000); 0 device-overwrite commits; boot
advances 171 -> 462 lines and 3 -> 6 assets (past ArcadeLogo.ptc, UI.xzp 23.5MB, Strings.bin). The GPU-device
teardown is GONE.

NEW FRONTIER (downstream, different class = the known function-boundary/jump-table problem, Update 3 workflow):
the boot now ends at two INDIRECT-NULLs, stable across all runs:
  [INDIRECT-NULL] target=0x8228A3B8 (caller lr=0x8228A210)  -- a missing jump-table case. 0x8228A3B8 is NOT a
    function start (absent from ppc_func_mapping); it is a mid-function label reached by a `bctr` inside
    sub_8228A208 (ppc_recomp.36.cpp:5667..8749, a ~3KB-line fn with a `mtctr;bctr` table). lr=0x8228A210 is
    STALE (bctr doesn't set LR). RECOVER per Update 3: gdb the table base/index at the bctr, read the BE-u32
    targets, add functions=[{address,size}] to sp_xenon.toml + a [[switch]] to sp_switch_tables.toml, clean
    regen ppc/ (rm ppc/*.cpp first), rebuild.
  [INDIRECT-NULL] target=0x00000000 (caller lr=0x8224FDEC)  -- a null call in ppc_recomp.30.cpp (likely an
    unfilled out-param/fn-ptr, Update 4 class, OR another table). Characterize after the first.
Then: more tables (Update 3 noted 9 deferred + 161 markers) -> the GPU CP draws -> VdSwap -> Plume Vulkan.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — ✅ jump table sub_8228A208 RECOVERED + vcmpbfp128/blrl IMPLEMENTED → boot 462→1191 lines (commits c10ab1a)
Past the heap fix, drove the boot through the next two blockers; new frontier is a CRT-init thread-join.

1. **Jump table in sub_8228A208 (the INDIRECT-NULL target=0x8228A3B8).** XenonAnalyse MISSES this table —
   it is a 16-bit OFFSET table (bctr @0x8228A3B4 → jumpbase 0x8228A3B8 + offtab[r19], offtab(u16) @0x820CCF38
   via `lhzx r0,0x820CCF38,r19*2`), and XenonAnalyse's prologue patterns don't match this two-level form
   (it found neighbours 0x822884C8/0x82289B74 but not this one). Recovered manually: bound `cmplwi r19,28;
   bgt 0x8228B6AC` ⇒ 29 cases (r19∈[0,28]), default 0x8228B6AC; read the 29 offsets from guest .rdata via
   gdb (/tmp/readtab.gdb), labels[i]=0x8228A3B8+offtab[i]. Added the [[switch]] to sp_switch_tables.toml
   (NO functions override — sub_8228A208 is already one whole function 0x8228A208..0x8228B858, unlike
   0x821DC228 which XenonAnalyse split). The downstream null call (lr=0x8224FDEC, a C++ virtual dispatch on
   a bad object) was a CONSEQUENCE of the skipped case and vanished once the table worked.

2. **vcmpbfp128 + blrl (the SIGTRAP after the jump table).** With the table fixed, the boot crashed (SIGTRAP)
   at sub_8241D010 (ppc_recomp.59.cpp, a Newton-Raphson reciprocal-refine on the main thread's CRT-init math):
   XenonRecomp emits `__builtin_debugtrap()` for recognised-but-unimplemented instructions. The crash was
   `vcmpbfp128` (vector compare-bounds). Implemented it + `blrl` in the emitter
   (patches/xenonrecomp-sp-instructions.patch, XenonRecomp/recompiler.cpp):
   - vcmpbfp[128]: per lane bit31=(a>b), bit30=(a<-b), 0 in [-b,b]; a<-b expressed as (-b)>a so only cmpgt
     is needed (xor flips b's sign); CR6 setFromMask on the `.` form.
   - blrl: capture lr as the target, set lr=return addr, PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC (mirror of bctrl).
   Rebuilt XenonRecomp → clean regen ppc/ (88 TUs) → only the 78 `vupkd3d128` debugtraps remain (D3D vertex
   unpack default-case, graphics-path, NOT yet reached). Regenerated the patch via `git -C ../../third_party/
   XenonRecomp diff`.
   RESULT (verified): 0 INDIRECT-NULL, 0 device-overwrite, NO crash (was SIGTRAP), boot 552→1191 lines, into
   GPU physical-buffer allocation (MmAllocatePhysicalMemoryEx 3.7MB blocks at 0xA2Fxxxxx). 8 threads.

3. **NEW FRONTIER = CRT-init thread-join deadlock.** Boot now reaches a quiescent steady state: all worker
   threads parked in KeWaitForMultipleObjects/NtWaitForMultipleObjectsEx on g_waitCv; one render worker
   (sub_821CC5D0 @0x821CC690) does a benign ~28 Hz KeGetCurrentProcessType poll (NOT the blocker). The
   **MAIN thread** is blocked forever: still in CRT static-init (sub_8214FFD0 global ctors) → sub_82448D78
   (thunk) → sub_8244E2D8 → **NtWaitForSingleObjectEx(handle=0xF1000002, timeout=∞)**. Handle 0xF1000002 =
   **thread tid=4** (start sub_8242B4A8, ppc_recomp.60.cpp:10096; created suspended at boot then resumed). Its
   KTHREAD resolves to 0x90100C40 (thread-arena 0x90100000+; events are a different arena 0x90400000+), whose
   dispatcher header is ALL-ZEROS (signal_state=0 = not terminated). So a global constructor spawns worker
   tid=4 and JOINS it (waits for it to exit), but tid=4 never exits (it is itself parked in a wait). RESUME:
   identify what tid=4 (sub_8242B4A8) does and what it waits on, and why it never terminates — a missing
   event signal, a queue it polls that is never fed, or a premature join. Tools: gdb attach + `thread apply
   all bt` (/tmp/{threads,t1,obj,h}.gdb); the wait is NtWaitForSingleObjectEx kernel.cpp:1272 / WaitObject:734.
   ⚠ XamLoaderLaunchTitle (a stub) is called around here but is NOT the blocker (the join is).

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — ✅ CRT-init thread-join = boot-logo "press A/START" timeout; cleared TWO stuck-clock/token bugs; new frontier = GPU CP fence completion (commit 6ecdea6)
Root-caused the CRT-init thread-join deadlock end-to-end and cleared its two causes. The join is the
**boot-logo screen**: a global ctor spawns tid=4 (sub_8242B4A8 → sub_8242B428 → sub_8214F730 →
**sub_8214F738**) to show the logo and JOINs it; main waits ∞ in NtWaitForSingleObjectEx(0x90100C40).

**1. The logo poll (sub_8214F738) — gdb-decoded.** It is a bounded "press A/START, else 5 s timeout"
poll: `start = GetTickCount(); loop { sub_82448928()→[r1+96]; if [r1+96]==0x5800(VK_PAD_A) || ==0x5814
(VK_PAD_START) exit; Sleep(5ms); if (GetTickCount()-start) >= 5000 exit }`. sub_82448928 →
**XamInputGetKeystrokeEx** (so [r1+96] is the keystroke VirtualKey). Timeout and keypress CONVERGE to
the same cleanup (loc_8214FD44, returns 0) — it is a "skip-or-wait-5s" logo, exactly what prod (no
controller) does via timeout. gdb at the loop: `now=0 start=0 elapsed=0 status=0x0000` every iter → the
clock never moved.

**2. Root cause = GetTickCount stuck at 0.** sub_82448748 (the CRT clock) returns
`*(*(0x820008B8)+16)` = **KeTimeStampBundle.TickCount** (+16). KeTimeStampBundle is xboxkrnl.exe data-
export **ordinal 0x00AD**; variant A leaves that import as the unresolved placeholder **0xAD000100** (the
addr the title dereferences — verified 4×, clear of every MmAllocatePhysical region) and never advanced
+16. So elapsed stayed 0 < 5000 forever. FIX (kernel.cpp): a dedicated ~1 ms host thread (StartTimestamp
Pump, started in SetupEnvironment) writes guest-uptime-ms to 0xAD000110, zeroes +0/+8 — mirrors
rexglue-sdk xboxkrnl_module.cpp's 1 ms timestamp timer. VERIFIED: tick advances (0→8913→12912 ms), the
5 s timeout fires, **tid=4 leaves the logo loop** (now at sub_8214F738:19568 = post-loop cleanup).

**3. Second bug = cooperative-token starvation (exactly the prompt's anticipated token issue).** Past the
logo, the cleanup `sub_8214F738 → sub_821C1000(×4 resources) → sub_821C0850 → sub_821C6E58` waits for a
GPU fence: `while *(*(device+10896)) < target { sub_821B9270() }`. **sub_821B9270 is a pure busy-spin
(db16cyc no-ops), no kernel yield** → the guest worker holds the execution token the whole time. But the
fence is advanced by the **vblank pump**, which must TAKE the token to run ExecutePM4 → the pump blocked
forever in std::mutex::lock(g_waitMutex) (gdb-CONFIRMED: pump parked at `__lll_lock_wait → … →
VblankPump():g_waitMutex.lock`). Deadlock: spinner waits for a fence only the pump can move; pump waits
for the token the spinner holds. FIX (kernel.cpp): strong override of the weak guest alias sub_821B9270
releases the token across the backoff (Unlock→sleep 1ms→Lock) then calls the recompiled body
__imp__sub_821B9270; skips the yield on the pump's own thread (it can re-enter via the gfx-interrupt
callback while holding the token). VERIFIED: pump now runs its normal 16 ms cycle (no longer lock-blocked),
the ring DRAINS (RPTR==WPTR==37).

**4. NEW FRONTIER = GPU CP fence completion (the renderer, multi-week).** With the pump running and the
ring drained (RPTR==WPTR==37, WPTR not advancing — title submits no more because tid=4 is still waiting),
the resource fence `*(*(device+10896))` STILL never reaches `target` (sub_821C6E58 r30). So the cleanup
wait (and main's join) does not yet lift. This is now a pure GPU command-processor gap: the PM4 the title
submitted does not drive that fence to target — either the completing EVENT_WRITE/fence packet was never
in the ring (the title would submit it only after the cleanup, which blocks — or the logo's draws were
never really rendered by the null/PM4 GPU), or the pump's EVENT_WRITE handling doesn't target
*(device+10896). RESUME: capture `*(device+10896)` (device ≈ 0x26F80; fence ptr at +10896, target =
sub_821C6E58 r30/r4) and compare to g_rptrWriteBack / the EVENT_WRITE addresses the pump writes; make the
CP advance that fence (the GPU engine). 0 INDIRECT-NULL, 0 device-overwrite, no crash throughout.

**Secondary finding (documented, NOT fixed):** sub_821B9270 also embeds a 5 s GPU **watchdog** that would
abort the wait (return 0) if the fence is stuck — but its tick is `r30 = *(KTHREAD+0x58)`, and FillKThread
sets T+0x54/0x56/0x5C yet **omits T+0x58** (rexglue X_KTHREAD `unk_58`), so it is pinned at 0 and the
watchdog can never fire. Even if ticked, the watchdog routes to sub_821C8B30 (DbgPrint + GPU hang-recovery),
i.e. a degraded "GPU hung" path, not clean progress — so the clean fix is #4 (CP completes the fence), not
the watchdog. Tools this session: gdb loop/fence/CP scripts (/tmp/{loopwatch,timer,fence,cp,full}.gdb),
`thread apply all bt`. ⚠ grep -a on boot logs.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — ✅ CRT-init join LIFTED via GPU fence-forward stopgap → boot reaches the GAME MAIN LOOP (intro movie)
Root-caused the GPU CP fence frontier end-to-end and cleared it (stopgap), driving the boot from the
stuck CRT-init join (≈1191 lines) all the way into the **game's main loop** (≈178k non-spam lines, ~355k
GPU frames executed in 30 s).

**Root cause — deferred command-buffer segments never reach variant A's CP.** Instrumented the fence wait
`sub_821C6E58` (entry: r3=device=0x26F80, r4=target): fenceptr=`*(device+10896)`=**0xA2010000** (the
0xA-window mirror our EVENT_WRITE_SHD writes to — address model VERIFIED correct, no mismatch), current
fence=**5**, target=**7**, head=`*(device+10908)`=**17**. A 5 s watcher proved head/fence/WPTR/RPTR are
ALL frozen (WPTR=37, ring all-zero past dword 37). So the fence is plumbed correctly but never reaches an
old target. Decode: the title's packet-builder `sub_821C6A08` (ppc_recomp.17.cpp:11952) does
`device+10908 = fence+2` per EVENT_WRITE — head=17 ⇒ it BUILT fences 3,5,7,9,11,13,15 but only **3,5** are
in the kicked ring. The ring-kick is `sub_821C6600` (writes CP_RB_WPTR 0x7FC80714); it fired **6×**
(WPTR 19→37) then STOPPED — the title defers the tail, relying on the real GPU auto-flushing partially
-filled segments. `sub_821C6E58`'s own gate (12508-12525) auto-flushes only when `target==head`; for an
OLDER fence (7≠17) it just spins. Tried driving the title's flush `sub_821C6D58` from the wait — it
advances head (17→19) but **kicks nothing** (its main-flush path finds no "current command buffer"; the
deferred segment needs the GPU↔CPU WAIT_REG_MEM handshake — the ring's tail IB 0x975E0 has
WAIT_REG_MEM packets referencing 0x2011xxx with code addr 0x821CC7A0 — which variant A skips).

**Fix (STOPGAP) — forward the completion fence past deferred segments.** Variant A's CP is synchronous and
has NO renderer, so a deferred segment's only effect on a waiter is the fence value itself (its draws/state
are no-ops). So in the two fence-spin waiters that the boot actually hits, forward the GPU-completion
marker to the requested target (forward-only) and let the wait succeed on its normal path:
- `sub_821C6E58` (counter wait): `GST32(*(device+10896), target)` when `target!=head` and not-yet-reached.
- `sub_821C5DF0` (post-frame segptr wait, sub_821BFF48→sub_821C6278→sub_821C5EA8→here): the marker is
  `*(fenceptr+4)` (segment pointer; low 2 bits = wrap generation); forward it to r5 when stuck.
(There are 6 `sub_821B9270` spin sites total — sub_821BFF48/C5DF0/C6420/C6E58/CB690/CC140 — only these two
are hit so far.) **NO faked completion of CPU-visible data; only the GPU-fence markers.**

**Result — the game BOOTS and RUNS.** join lifts (tid=4 teardown completes → ExTerminateThread → main's
NtWaitForSingleObjectEx(0x90100C40) returns) → main runs CRT global ctors → enters the render loop. It
loads real game assets (LuaScripts, Fonts, Audio, AnimBlock.bin 1.4 MB, Stickers, subtitles), spawns more
worker threads, and runs the **intro state machine**, rendering ~12k GPU frames/s. 0 device-overwrites, no
crash, 1 benign INDIRECT-NULL (null fn-ptr target=0 @lr=0x82292D08, skipped).

**NEW FRONTIER = missing intro movie (content gap, not a recomp bug).** The loop is stuck retrying
`NtCreateFile('game:\Media\Assets\Movies\en-en\sp_xbox_0_intro.wmv')` → **MISS**. The extracted Movies/
dir has all Level1-11 movies but **no `en-en/` subdir and no sp_xbox_0_intro.wmv** (the localized intro
movies were not extracted). The game retries every frame. NEXT: either provide the file (check the XBLA
package for the en-en movie set) or make the intro skip on missing-movie; then chase VdSwap → first frame.

**⚠ The fence-forward is a STOPGAP** — it must be replaced by a continuous CP that follows the
WAIT_REG_MEM-chained deferred IBs and executes them (so the fence advances as a real result) BEFORE a real
renderer lands, or deferred draws would be skipped. Build/run unchanged (ninja -C runtime/out
sp_td_varianta). Diagnostics added (gated): ExecuteType3 full opcode trace under REX_CPTRACE=1; [fencefwd]
under REX_KTRACE=1.

## 2026-06-01 (cont.) — boot reaches & PLAYS the intro movie; the wall is now the GPU RENDERER (confirmed)
Followed the post-join boot to its natural limit. Findings:
- **The render loop works.** `VdSwap` IS called every frame (from sub_821BFF48) presenting *sequential
  framebuffers* (r3 = 0xA0013734, 0xA009B3B4, 0xA0123B74, … ~0x88000 apart = distinct frame targets). Our
  stub was silent so earlier "VdSwap=0" was a logging artifact, not absence. Improved VdSwap to advance the
  GPU swap counter (g_gpuCounter++) + log the first calls. The title renders to framebuffers + presents;
  variant A just can't *display* them (no Vulkan backend — DRAW_INDX is a no-op in ExecutePM4).
- **The intro movie loads & plays.** game:\Media\Assets\Movies\en-en\sp_xbox_0_intro.wmv (path fixed via
  en-en/ symlink) → NtQueryInformationFile size=8479541 → allocate 0x820000 → NtReadFile reads the whole
  8.4 MB → RtlInitializeCriticalSection ×~17 (player init) → MmAllocatePhysicalMemoryEx ×N (GPU mem) →
  ExCreateThread ×4 (tid 11-14, start 0x82339428.. = the VC-1/WMV decoder threads). So the title genuinely
  enters movie playback.
- **It is RENDERER-GATED, not slow.** A 180 s run produced **1,099,927 non-spam lines** but NEVER advanced
  past the movie (no NtClose on the movie handle, no menu assets, no next file). 180 s ≫ enough for even a
  5-10× slowed CPU VC-1 decode of an 8.4 MB intro. The movie playback (and thus the intro→menu transition)
  needs frames actually drawn/displayed — i.e. the GPU renderer. Main cycles through the movie-player render
  fns (sub_821D5910 → sub_822045E0 → …); 13 threads, all healthy (no deadlock, no crash, 0 device-overwrite).

**CONCLUSION — the boot-bring-up frontier is EXHAUSTED; the remaining work is the GPU renderer.** Variant
A's CP is a minimal PM4 interpreter (IB/INTERRUPT/EVENT_WRITE_SHD-fence/swap; draws = no-ops). To advance
past the intro (and to display anything) it needs a real PM4→Vulkan translator: GPU-state tracking from
SET_CONSTANT/type-0 register writes, Xenos-microcode→SPIR-V shader translation, DRAW_INDX→Vulkan draw,
texture/RT/vertex binding, and a Vulkan swapchain presented on VdSwap/XE_SWAP. That is exactly what
rexglue's command_processor + Vulkan backend (Xenia-based) already do — so the realistic options are
(a) port a minimal renderer, (b) integrate rexglue's existing Vulkan backend/Plume into variant A's runtime,
or (c) the fake-skip-the-intro stopgap to exercise more title LOGIC (menu/gameplay) for recomp coverage
(no display). This is a multi-week, deliberate phase — flagged for a human scope decision, not autonomous
loop work.

## 2026-06-02 (post-reboot) — RENDERER PART 1 REFRAMED: per-frame draws never reach the ring (REX_DEFERCP refuted)

Resumed after a host crash/reboot at clean HEAD `d0e1a3e`. Baseline re-verified: boot reaches the intro,
presents double-buffered framebuffers (0xA2016000/0xA23AE000, 1280x720 fmt=6), 0 device-overwrite, no crash.

Traced a full frame (REX_DEFERCP=1 + configurable REX_CPDUMP=N + REX_DRAWLOG). Findings overturn the
"linearly parse the staging/deferred buffer" approach (REX_DEFERCP):

- The per-frame staging buffer at 0xA01xxxxx is NOT a clean PM4 stream. A linear PM4 walk stays aligned for
  only ~2000 of ~139000 dwords/frame, then desyncs HARD: the op histogram becomes near-uniform across all
  0x00-0x7F (garbage signature), and the walk runs into INLINE VERTEX FLOATS (0x441FE000=639.0f=1280/2,
  0x44DD0000=1768.0f, …) and segment-address words masked as type3 (raw 0xC02B7784 == addr 0xA02B7784). It is
  the title's custom linked command SEGMENTS — markers op 0x38(cnt2)/0x79(cnt10) carrying segment addrs (e.g.
  data `8100008B 00013640 C009790C`) — interleaved with inline vertex data. Not walkable linearly.

- rexglue/Xenia 1:1 ref (agent-mapped graphics/command_processor.cpp + include xenos.h): there is NO deferred /
  system-command-buffer execution path. ALL GPU work reaches the CP via the MAIN RING. VdGetSystemCommandBuffer
  is a stub (0xBEEF, same as ours). VdSwap writes its swap PM4 (TYPE0 fetch-const + PM4_XE_SWAP) INTO the ring.
  Texture fetch constants come from SET_CONSTANT(0x2D, type=1)->reg 0x4800 (our CP does NOT handle 0x2D — a
  gap) or type-0 writes. kImmediate inline indices unsupported; vertices come from bound buffers.

- DIRECT ring dump (new one-time KTRACE diag in VdSwap): ring base=0xA0002000 size=0x1000 (1024 dwords). After
  init it holds ME_INIT + exactly 6 setup IBs (->0xA0090040/0xA0010000/0xA00900E0/0xA0010100/0xA00975A0/
  0xA00975E0) and CP_RB_WPTR == CP_RB_RPTR == 37 — fully consumed, NOTHING past WPTR. The guest writes NO
  per-frame commands to the ring. r3 in VdSwap = 0xA0123B74 (r7=0xBEEF0001) lies in the staging region, far
  outside the 0x1000 ring — r3 is the staging write-point, not a ring pointer.

- prod oracle (renders the SAME guest: 54 pipelines incl. PS adf7088205c03df9) launched & confirmed rendering,
  so on the correct path the title DOES feed the ring per-frame. sub_821C6600 ("the kick") hit only ~1x in 5s
  under gdb on prod (likely init-only) -> the per-frame ring submission is some OTHER path.

CONCLUSION: the per-frame draws are built in the staging buffer (0xA01xxxxx) but the title's FLUSH to the ring
(sub_821C6D58: write IB packets to the ring + advance WPTR) never fires in variant A — gated on a GPU<->CPU
WAIT_REG_MEM handshake that the fence-forward stopgap does not reproduce. The tiny ring is meant to carry IB
packets pointing to staging segments; our existing ring-CP would render them IF they were kicked. So
REX_DEFERCP (linear staging parse) is the WRONG target. Real part-1 work = get the segment draws to the CP:
either (A) model the handshake so the title's own flush fires, or (B) decode the segment descriptors and
execute each segment as an IB ourselves. (Also: add SET_CONSTANT 0x2D handling for fetch constants.)

Diagnostics added this commit (gated/one-time, boot unregressed): configurable REX_CPDUMP=N cap + op
0x38/0x79/draw data dump in ExecutePM4; one-time ring walk in VdSwap flagging IB targets + WPTR/RPTR.

## 2026-06-02 (post-reboot, cont.) — RENDERER PART 1: route B (segment-CP) VALIDATED — clean aligned draws

User chose route B (decode the title's segments, execute each as an IB). Implemented + validated:
- Instrumented the ring-kick sub_821C6600: the 6 init kicks reveal the SEGMENT DESCRIPTOR format
  definitively = a 2-dword {d0 = 0x81000000 | len_dwords, d1 = phys_addr}. e.g. d0=8100000B d1=00090040
  -> IB->0xA0090040 len=11; d0=8100010A d1=00010100 -> IB->0xA0010100 len=266. The "op 0x38" payloads seen
  earlier in the staging stream (8100008B 00013640, ...) ARE exactly these descriptors embedded inline.
- REX_SEGCP=1: scan this frame's staging range [prev_r3,cur_r3] for the descriptor signature
  ((d0&0xFFFF0000)==0x81000000 + sane len/addr) and execute each referenced segment as a bounded IB
  ExecutePM4(0xA0000000|d1, len, depth=1). RESULT: ~8 segments/frame, ~9 draws/frame, and they are CLEAN +
  ALIGNED (all init=0x30088 numInd=3 prim=8 = kRectangleList) — NOT the desync garbage the linear DEFERCP
  produced (init=0xC0000000 numInd=49152). 0 device-overwrite, no crash, boot reaches intro. => route B's
  segment-IB model WORKS; segments are clean PM4 and parse aligned.
- Added SET_CONSTANT(0x2D) + SET_CONSTANT2(0x55) to ExecuteType3 (type1->reg0x4800 fetch/textures,
  type4->+0x2000 regs, type0->+0x4000 ALU, 2->+0x4900, 3->+0x4908; per rexglue command_processor.cpp).
  Made REX_DRAWLOG=N configurable.

LIMITATION / NEXT: the embedded-descriptor scan finds only a UNIFORM subset — across 500 logged draws 100%
are init=0x30088 (untextured rects), ZERO bound textures. So these are one layer (clears/fills); the
textured bulk (movie quad, sprites, the ~808-draw dominant pshader adf7088205c03df9) is in segments NOT
referenced by inline descriptors. The COMPLETE per-frame segment list lives in the flush sub_821C6D58's
queue: flush -> sub_821C6810 (provides segment region+count r30) -> sub_821C6C80 (consumes; r8=device+13568
array base, r6=count) -> kick. Device fields: +10896 completion-ctr ptr, +10908 head fence, +13408/+13568
segment tracking, +10940/10941 gate bytes (flush skips the segment block if device+13408!=0). NEXT:
empirically hook sub_821C6C80 / read the device+13568 array to enumerate ALL segments (incl. textured), then
present the movie quad's bound texture (shortcut to visible content).

## 2026-06-02 (post-reboot, cont. 2) — the intro emits only ~5-8 untextured rects/frame; content is GATED

Pushed route B further to locate the textured/movie draws. Findings:
- Device struct segment-tracking (one-time devdump): device=0x26F80, +10896=A2010000 (completion-ctr ptr),
  +10908=0x45 (head fence, grew from init), +13408=0 (flush segment-gate is OPEN, not skipping), +13568=
  current command-buffer base (GROWS ~0x88680/frame: 0xA0090180 -> ... -> 0xA055BF00 -> 0xA066D000 — i.e.
  the SAME growing per-frame buffer r3 points into, just another cursor). The struct also holds a pool of
  0x1080-byte chunk records {base, writeptr, 0x1080, base+4, 0, device}.
- REX_CHUNKCP=1 (execute the device+13568 active command buffer [base,writeptr) linearly as an IB): DESYNCS
  exactly like the r3-staging linear parse — recovers init=0xC0000000 (x118, packet headers read as draws),
  prim=60 (invalid) garbage; only a handful of real init=0x30088 rects. So the device chunk is the SAME
  mixed buffer (PM4 + inline vertex data + 0x8100xxxx segment descriptors), NOT a clean IB.
- BRUTE draw-scan of a whole frame's staging range: only ~5 real DRAW packets, ALL init=0x30088 prim=8
  (kRectangleList), untextured. REX_SEGCP (descriptor-referenced segments) likewise: ~8/frame, 100% of 500
  logged draws = init=0x30088 rects, ZERO bound textures across the entire run.

CONCLUSION (leading hypothesis, strong evidence): during the intro variant A's title emits only ~5-8
untextured rectangle draws per frame and NEVER builds the movie/textured draws. prod renders the intro (54
pipelines, real shaders) from the SAME guest, so on the correct path the title DOES build movie draws. The
difference is the GPU<->CPU handshake: the fence-forward stopgap lets the boot's waits return (so it loops)
but does NOT truly drive GPU/decode progress, so the title idles in a minimal per-frame loop (clear rects +
VdGetSystemCommandBuffer) and never advances to decode+present the movie. Ring stays frozen (6 init kicks).
=> Route B validated the segment model + the descriptor format + the command-buffer pool, and produces clean
aligned draws from descriptor segments — but the MOVIE will not appear until the handshake (route A) drives
the title forward. The two routes CONVERGE: the root blocker is the real GPU<->CPU fence/sync handshake, not
the segment parsing. NEXT: (A) model the handshake — make fences advance as a true RESULT of CP execution of
kicked ring content (replace the fence-forward stopgap), so the title proceeds to build+render the movie; or
investigate whether the intro movie uses a non-PM4 path (VdInitializeScalerCommandBuffer / overlay) we stub.
New diags (gated): REX_CHUNKCP, [drawscan], [devdump], g_device capture.

## 2026-06-02 (cont. 3) — route A fence instrumentation REVISES the premise: the title is NOT fence-gated

Started route A (model the handshake); instrumented the fence wait sub_821C6E58 ([fencewait], capped). The
data revises the "gated" hypothesis from cont.2:
- target = head - 8 ALWAYS; gap (target-current) is a constant 6; head climbs smoothly 17 -> 1439+ over 240
  waits (and far beyond, capped). The title builds ~3 segments (~6 fences)/frame and waits only for the GPU
  to stay within 8 fences (4 segments) — a PIPELINE-DEPTH THROTTLE, not a stuck wait.
- The forward satisfies the throttle every frame (28380 load-bearing forwards); the title progresses frame
  after frame the whole run, presenting each frame (framebuffer empty — only rects drawn).
=> The title is NOT fence-blocked; it actively runs its per-frame render loop, just emitting only untextured
rects. So route A's premise (a gated title the handshake unblocks) does NOT hold — replacing the forward with
real fence execution keeps the same smooth loop and would NOT change what is drawn.

REFRAME: the textured draws DO exist (prod renders the same guest with 54 pipelines, so the guest builds
textured PM4 draws each frame), but variant A is NOT CAPTURING them — they live in per-frame command-buffer
content our CP/scan doesn't reach. Evidence: brute draw-scan + SEGCP of the r3-staging range find only ~5-9
draws/frame, all init=0x30088 rects; the textured bulk is in other segments/buffers (the device-tracked
cmd-buffer pool, device+13568, grows ~0x88680/frame; its records reference 0xA04D-0xA056xxxx chunks). So the
real problem is COMPLETE per-frame command-buffer COVERAGE/enumeration, not the fence handshake. Options:
(1) decoded-frame shortcut — find the VC-1 decoder's output surface (4 threads @0x82339428) and present it
    directly (visible intro, sidesteps buffer RE); (2) full cmd-buffer enumeration — crack the device-tracked
    pool / segment format so ALL per-frame draws reach the CP (the general renderer path, hard).
Added [fencewait] instrumentation (gated).

## 2026-06-02 (cont. 4) — decoded-frame shortcut: there IS no decoded frame — the VC-1 decoder is idle

Pursued the user-chosen decoded-frame shortcut (find the VC-1 decoder output + present it directly):
- Captured the decoder's frame-pool buffers (16 allocs from one site LR 0x8244DD2C, ~0x101440 each).
  Full-buffer scan: ALL are uniform fills (Y=0x00 black luma / chroma=0x80 neutral), varied=0 everywhere —
  i.e. cleared-to-black, NO real decoded image (real VC-1 output is never perfectly uniform).
- WMV is fully loaded: one NtReadFile of 8479541 bytes (the 8.4MB sp_xbox_0_intro.wmv) into memory; demux
  reads from RAM after (no further file reads).
- BROAD heap scan (0x1000000..0x9000000, 0x10000 chunks, report high adjacent-byte variation) for ANY
  image-like region: found only (a) Lua/script TEXT at 0x2E9-0x2F2xxxx (visible strings), and (b) a
  FULL-ENTROPY region 0x496-0x4Axxxxx (varied=16384/16384) inside the 23MB alloc at 0x48D0000 = the
  COMPRESSED WMV bitstream (full entropy = compressed, not decoded; decoded frames have spatial smoothness).
  NO decoded video frame anywhere in the heap.
=> CONCLUSION: there is NO decoded frame to present — the VC-1 decoder has its input (compressed WMV in RAM)
but produces NO output (its frame buffers stay uniform black). The decoder is IDLE / gated. So the intro is
not invisible because of the renderer — the MOVIE DECODE PIPELINE is not running. This unifies the session's
findings: the title runs a healthy per-frame loop (not fence-gated), draws only clear rects, presents empty
buffers, and the movie never decodes. Getting the intro visible needs the DECODER to run (a video/XMA-decode
subsystem investigation: why are the decoder threads tid11-14 @0x82339428 idle — waiting on demux input, a
GPU surface, or a play trigger?), OR skip the intro to exercise menu/gameplay rendering instead. All 3
near-term options' premises now mapped: route A (title not gated), route B (only rects built during intro),
shortcut (no decoded frame). Diagnostics added (gated): video-buffer capture (g_videoBufs, LR 0x8244DD2C) +
broad heap image-scan in VdSwap.

## 2026-06-02 (cont. 5) — intro is MOVIE-gated (not input-skippable); root points at the coop scheduler

User chose "skip intro -> render menu". Findings:
- The intro does NOT poll input: XamInputGetState is called EXACTLY ONCE in a 25s run (hot loop = 33654x
  VdGetSystemCommandBuffer). Injecting a CONNECTED pad with START, then pulsed A+START (REX_SKIPINTRO, via
  XamInputGetState + XamInputGetCapabilities) does NOT advance past the intro (identical asset set, no menu
  load). => the intro transition is MOVIE-gated (plays until movie-EOF / first-frame ready), not a skip
  button. (REX_SKIPINTRO kept, gated — may matter in the menu, which likely does poll input.)
- gdb all-thread bt of the running boot (26 threads): only Thread 1 (main) executes guest code (holds the
  single coop token) — busy in the per-frame intro builder (sub_821FACD0 <- ... <- sub_822170E8). 11 threads
  parked in lll_lock_wait (waiting for the token), 6 in pthread_cond_wait. Threads 10/11 wait in
  KeWaitForSingleObject from sub_821CC5D0 (the 0x821CCxxx GPU-sync region) = GPU-completion workers. The VC-1
  decoder threads (entry sub_82339428) appear in NO guest frame at any depth and are NOT in KeWait — they're
  parked in lll_lock_wait, i.e. waiting for the coop TOKEN (not an event/data gate).
=> LEADING ROOT: the cooperative single-token scheduler keeps the CPU-heavy VC-1 decoder threads from
running (they compete with the busy main thread + ~10 other workers for ONE token), so the movie never
decodes (frame buffers stay uniform black) -> never plays/EOFs -> the intro never advances. This is exactly
RENDERER-PHASE-PLAN Step 1 (fibers / a real scheduler), deferred earlier as "coop token sufficient for now" —
it is NOT sufficient for movie decode. (Caveat: could also be a main<->decoder start/feed handshake; exact
gate needs reading the decoder threads' saved guest PC. But the decoder is parked on the token, not an
event.) STRATEGIC: visible content needs ONE of (a) a better scheduler/threading so the decoder runs -> movie
plays -> intro auto-advances to menu/gameplay (then the renderer for the drawn content); (b) force the
movie-player "done" state to skip the intro (movie-player RE); (c) the renderer's full command-buffer
enumeration (needed regardless). All multi-session, title-specific. Added REX_SKIPINTRO (gated input inject).

## 2026-06-02 (cont. 6) — the decoder is STUCK, not merely starved (90s run = zero progress)

90s run, late sample (swap#220) of the VC-1 frame pool: the 16 buffers are BIT-IDENTICAL to the frame-40
sample (buf0 nz=0; buf1 nz=131728; buf2 nz=65864; ... varied=0 everywhere) — ZERO progress over 90s. So the
decoder is NOT just slow/starved (that would accrue partial frames) — it is STUCK: it never writes real
content into its pool. The decoder threads cycle on the coop token but are blocked BEFORE the decode (the
playback never starts/feeds), so nothing decodes. => refines cont.5: the intro hang is a STUCK movie-PLAYBACK
pipeline (decoder waits for work; main thread loops presenting empty frames without driving playback), not
pure scheduler starvation. Reaching visible content needs deep RE of the movie-player start/feed path (or
the menu, which sits behind the same stuck intro). NET for the session: the wall is now COMPLETELY mapped,
but visible content was not reached — every remaining path is multi-session title-specific RE.

## 2026-06-02 (cont. 7) — ✅ intro→menu transition RE'd + FORCED: title now advances intro→attract→menu-setup (NOT pushed)
User directive: "force «movie ended» (pinpoint-RE the intro→menu transition condition)". Done, and the intro
hang is now BROKEN — the title advances past the intro into the attract loop and into menu/frontend setup.

### The transition mechanism (RE'd end-to-end; prod oracle confirms)
- Per frame the movie widget's driver `sub_82425BF8` calls the player AdvanceFrame dispatch `sub_8232AAE0`
  (= `(*(*player+72))(player,...)`, player = `*(widget+76)`). It returns a status in facility 0x1666:
  **0x166600E8** = "no frame / buffering" (variant A's stuck-decoder steady state), **0x16660026** = EOS
  (produced by `sub_8233A7D0`). On EOS, `sub_82425BF8` POSTS the completion (`sub_822221C8` + `sub_8222A9F8`,
  channel 0xAAC0CCDD, event type 8).
- The completion is consumed by the per-frame screen state machine `sub_82161920` (driven by the event/state
  pump `sub_82150770`), which in its **state==2** branch dispatches `sub_82163118` = the intro→menu advance.
- PROD ORACLE (gdb, SIGSEGV passed through so its write-watch handler runs): the intro movie runs **~534
  frames / ~22 s** (t=25.2→47.3s under gdb), then EOS fires and the completion path tears the movie down
  (`sub_82425648` via `sub_824259F8`/`sub_82425F50` and via `sub_82150770→sub_82161920→sub_82163118→…→
  sub_824267B0`) and advances. ⚠ NOTE: the transition does NOT swap the screen-manager's current-screen
  (`*(0x828EAB18+12)` unchanged in prod) — a hardware watchpoint there never fires; the intro/menu is a
  sub-state, not a top screen swap. (`+0x8C`/child-list reads are unreliable — discard.)

### Two gates, both forced (env-gated levers in kernel.cpp; default-off, boot unregressed)
1. **`REX_MOVIE_EOF=N`** — variant A's VC-1 decoder is stuck, so AdvanceFrame returns 0x166600E8 FOREVER
   (no EOS). Wrap `sub_8232AAE0`: after N advances of the movie player (captured as `*(widget+76)` in a
   `sub_82425BF8` wrap), force its return to 0x16660026. PROVEN: movie pump stops (no-force = 44,820 advances
   in 30s and climbing; force@30 = plateaus at 30) and the completion poster `sub_8222A9F8` fires. But ALONE
   it does NOT advance — the movie self-stops, the intro keeps running.
2. **`REX_XFLAG=1`** — `sub_82163118` (the advance) is gated, even in state 2, behind a global
   "screen-transitions-enabled" byte **`0x828E82A6`**, which prod's `sub_8210AF90` sets to 1 but which is **0
   in variant A** (`sub_8210AF90` never reached). gdb-verified: owner reaches state 2, `owner+72=1`,
   `g(0x828EEF1C)=1`, but `g(0x828E82A6)=0` → `sub_82163118` ticks=0. Forcing the byte in the `sub_82161920`
   wrap makes `sub_82163118` run.

### Result (REX_MOVIE_EOF=30 + REX_XFLAG=1 [+ REX_SKIPINTRO])
- With both: `sub_82163118` runs, the completion is processed, and the title ADVANCES out of the intro into
  the **attract loop** — it opens `towerDefense_attract_movie.wmv` (symlinked into `Movies/en-en/` like the
  intro; it exists in `Movies/`) and cycles intro↔attract (the classic console demo loop). No crash,
  0 device-overwrite. The long-standing intro hang is GONE.
- `REX_SKIPINTRO` now also injects a pulsed **VK_PAD_START (0x5814) keystroke via XamInputGetKeystrokeEx**
  (the title/logo poll path; the old XamInputGetState-only inject didn't reach it). With all three gates the
  title leaves the attract loop and enters **menu/frontend setup**: main thread runs the screen state machine
  `sub_82150770 → sub_8215DBD0`, allocates menu GPU buffers (`MmAllocatePhysicalMemoryEx 0x195000/0x3000/
  0x10000`), then hits the **NEXT BLOCKER: `[INDIRECT-NULL] target=0xFFFFFFFF (caller lr=0x8215DE84)`** — a
  null screen vtable/jump-table slot in the frontend setup (the project's known function-boundary/jump-table
  class, Update-3 workflow; OR a method unimplemented because the renderer is absent).

### Diagnostics / method
- prod oracle under gdb is viable IF `handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint pass` (prod uses SIGSEGV for GPU
  write-watch; default gdb intercepts it and looks like a crash in sub_821C6AF8). prod base = 0x100000000.
- Hooks added (all gated, passthrough when off): `g_moviePlayer` capture (sub_82425BF8 wrap), `sub_8232AAE0`
  (REX_MOVIE_EOF), `sub_82161920` (REX_XFLAG), `sub_8222A9F8` completion-post log, `XamInputGetKeystroke(Ex)`
  START inject (REX_SKIPINTRO). Build `ninja -C runtime/out sp_td_varianta`.

### NEXT (resume here)
- **Reach the menu fully:** root-cause the INDIRECT-NULL `0xFFFFFFFF @ sub_8215DE84` (read the vtable/jump
  table at the call site in sub_8215Dxxx; recover it per the Update-3 workflow, or implement the missing
  screen method). This is the gateway from frontend-setup to a live menu.
- **Proper fix for the REX_XFLAG stopgap:** find why `sub_8210AF90` (sets 0x828E82A6=1) is never called in
  variant A (an init divergence; trace its caller, diff prod) so transitions enable themselves.
- The movie still never DECODES (decoder stuck) — these forces make the title BEHAVE as if the movie ended;
  for a visible intro the decoder/scheduler work (cont. 5/6) is still open. But for exercising menu/gameplay
  rendering, the force chain is the way in.

## 2026-06-02 (cont. 8) — proper fix for REX_XFLAG: root = cooperative-scheduler starvation (multi-session); band-aid reverted
User picked "proper fix instead of the REX_XFLAG stopgap: why is sub_8210AF90 (sets 0x828E82A6) never called
in variant A?" Root-caused to a CHAIN of cooperative-scheduler issues — NOT a one-liner. No code kept
(the band-aid regressed; reverted to HEAD 176b54d). Findings:

- **0x828E82A6 is a one-time init flag**: the ONLY writer is `sub_8210AF90` (`li r11,1; stb r11,-32090(0x828F0000)`),
  which is a TEARDOWN of the global app object `0x828E8AF8` (frees fields +184..+200 via sub_82448D78/
  sub_8244D670/sub_82448B50, clears +237) that — as a side effect — enables screen transitions. BSS-zero
  until set, never cleared. So REX_XFLAG (force `g_base[0x828E82A6]=1`) faithfully replicates its flag effect.
- **sub_8210AF90 has no direct callers** — it's a vtable method invoked indirectly. PROD bt (gdb, `handle
  SIGSEGV nostop pass` so prod's GPU write-watch runs; prod base=0x100000000): worker thread `sub_82450FD0`
  (xapi trampoline) → `sub_82250420` (a work-queue loop: wait `sub_8244DC18` → `*(workobj)->vtable[0]()`) →
  `sub_8211B740` (work handler, vtable[0] of workobj 0x828E8BB0) → `sub_8210AF90`, at t≈0 (early boot).
- **variant A DOES spawn + resume that worker**: `ExCreateThread(start=0x82250420 ctx=0x828E8BB0 flags=1
  SUSPENDED) -> tid=10`, and `NtResumeThread(0xF100000F) -> started`. BUT tid=10 **never runs its guest
  entry** (`sub_82250420` ENTER=0 via a hook): an all-thread gdb bt shows **3 resumed guest threads parked
  at `GuestThreadRun:804` = `g_waitMutex.lock()`** (the cooperative single-token acquire) — they never won
  the token. The main thread's tight per-frame intro loop holds/re-wins the token; tid=10 was resumed LATE
  (after the boot window where the earlier workers tids 5/7/8 got their turns), so it STARVES. This is the
  long-flagged Step-1 issue (the cooperative token is not fair).
- **Targeted band-aid TESTED + REVERTED**: a yield-on-resume in NtResumeThread (release the token after
  spawning so the new thread runs its init to its first wait). Result: tid=10 now STARTS and processes its
  init work (`sub_82250420` ENTER=1, `sub_8211B740` runs) — BUT (a) `sub_8211B740` STILL doesn't reach
  `sub_8210AF90` even over 40s (a FURTHER divergence: sub_8211B740's work/state differs from prod's; it's a
  718-line init fn with many vtable dispatches), and (b) it **REGRESSED** the existing REX_XFLAG advance
  (changing the cooperative scheduling breaks the determinism the design relies on: attract no longer
  reached). Reverted (git checkout); confirmed the committed REX_XFLAG advance is restored (attract reached).
- **CONCLUSION**: REX_XFLAG masks (1) cooperative-scheduler startup-starvation of tid=10 AND (2) a deeper
  `sub_8211B740 → sub_8210AF90` state divergence. The proper fix = a FAIR cooperative scheduler (the
  long-deferred RENDERER-PHASE-PLAN Step 1: fibers/real scheduler) + resolving the sub_8211B740 init-state
  divergence — multi-session, title-specific. A naive band-aid regresses the boot. **REX_XFLAG stays as the
  pragmatic stopgap** (it replicates sub_8210AF90's flag side-effect exactly). Diagnostics this session were
  temporary (REX_INITDIAG) and were reverted with the band-aid; the prod-oracle method (`handle SIGSEGV
  nostop pass`, ExCreateThread-log thread map, all-thread bt → GuestThreadRun:804 token-parked count) is the
  reusable technique. NET: no code change (HEAD stays 176b54d); the deliverable is the root-cause + the
  verdict that the fix is the Step-1 scheduler work.

## 2026-06-02 (cont. 9) — Step 1: fair cooperative scheduler IMPLEMENTED (boots stably) + REAL root found = main never yields; ⚠ env broke mid-test
User picked option 2 (the fair scheduler / Step 1). Implemented it, found it boots stably, but discovered the
starvation root is NOT token fairness — it's that the MAIN THREAD NEVER YIELDS the token in the steady intro
loop. ⚠ The dev environment then degraded (see end); the work is UNCOMMITTED in the working tree.

### What was built (kernel.cpp, gated REX_FAIRSCHED, default path byte-unchanged)
- A fair FIFO run-token `class FairMutex` (ticket lock: lock takes next_++, waits serving_==my; unlock does
  serving_++ + notify) replacing the unfair plain `g_waitMutex` WHEN g_fair. The run-token (g_tok) is held by
  the one running guest thread; object-waits are SEPARATED onto `g_objM`/`g_objCv` — a thread blocked on a
  guest dispatch object releases g_tok (FairWaitUntil), waits on g_objCv until signaled, re-acquires g_tok
  FIFO-fairly. SignalObject (fair) writes signal_state under g_objM + notifies g_objCv. FairWaitUntil loops +
  re-checks under the token (handles auto-reset consume races). Branched: WaitObject, KeWaitForMultipleObjects,
  NtWaitForMultipleObjectsEx, GuestThreadRun, LockGuestExecution/UnlockGuestExecution, VblankPump, SignalObject.
- VERIFIED (before the env broke): default boot (g_fair off) UNCHANGED (intro, 0 device-overwrite, progress
  ~32k); REX_FAIRSCHED=1 BOOTS STABLY — reaches the intro, NO crash/deadlock, progress higher (~50-95k = more
  threads run). So the fair-token core is correct + deadlock-free.

### REAL root (gdb-verified) — fairness ALONE doesn't help
- Even under REX_FAIRSCHED, tid=10 (sub_82250420, the transitions-enable worker) + the VC-1 decoder threads
  (0x82339428/58) STILL never run. A GuestThreadRun token-acquire log shows tid=10 "WAITING (g_tok next=1306
  **serving=1305 held=1**)" but never "GOT token"; decoders likewise. No spurious unlocks (lock/unlock balanced).
- ⇒ the MAIN THREAD holds the run-token (ticket 1305) and runs the steady intro loop WITHOUT EVER YIELDING:
  the **fence-forward stopgap makes its GPU fence-waits instant** (no block → no FairWaitUntil → no g_tok
  release), and its other waits are pre-satisfied. So `serving` is frozen at 1305 and NO other guest thread
  can run — INDEPENDENT of token fairness. (Same in default mode; the fair token just makes it explicit.)
  This is why the earlier yield-on-resume "worked" once: it forced a single release. The general fix is
  cooperative TIME-SLICING: make the main release the token periodically.
- Was testing exactly that: a per-frame token yield at `sub_82167248` (gated g_fair: UnlockGuestExecution();
  LockGuestExecution()). This is IN the working tree but the build/test DID NOT COMPLETE.

### ⚠ Dev-environment degradation (mid-test) — NOT a code bug
- The Bash shell's stdout capture broke (even `echo X` returns exit 1 / no output; commands' output files come
  back empty). Cause: this session ran the title ~15× and `timeout` sends SIGTERM, which the multithreaded
  title IGNORES → orphaned processes each mmapping 4 GiB + holding a /dev/shm xenia_memory_* → RAM/resource
  exhaustion. Killed orphans via `pkill -9 -x sp_td_varianta` (NOT `-f` — that self-matches the shell), but the
  shell capture did not recover within the session. ⇒ could not build-verify / test the per-frame yield / commit.

### STATE + NEXT (resume precisely)
- Working tree: kernel.cpp has UNCOMMITTED fair-scheduler + per-frame-yield + REX_INITDIAG diag hooks (all
  gated by REX_FAIRSCHED / REX_INITDIAG; default boot unaffected). Last commit = b967e92 (clean kernel.cpp =
  176b54d). The per-frame-yield edit is UNBUILT/UNTESTED.
- NEXT: (1) restart the dev env / free RAM (`pkill -9 -x sp_td_varianta`; rm /dev/shm/xenia_memory_*); ALWAYS
  run the title with `timeout -s KILL N` (it ignores SIGTERM). (2) build-verify kernel.cpp (`ninja -C
  runtime/out sp_td_varianta`). (3) Test REX_FAIRSCHED=1 + REX_INITDIAG=1 + REX_MOVIE_EOF=30 (no REX_XFLAG):
  does the per-frame yield let tid=10 GET the token → sub_8211B740 → sub_8210AF90 (flag set) AND the decoders
  run (movie decode!) AND the intro advance? grep [initdiag] 'GOT token' / 'sub_8210AF90 RAN' / towerDefense.
  (4) If it works → big Step-1 win (keep + make default carefully, watch for the determinism regression that
  yield-on-resume showed). If it regresses/doesn't help → the deeper interaction is the fence-forward stopgap
  (replace it with a real fence so the main genuinely blocks/yields). (5) Build-verify then commit or revert.
- KEY INSIGHT for Step 1: the cooperative-scheduler problem is the MAIN-THREAD-NEVER-YIELDS (tied to the
  fence-forward stopgap), NOT token fairness. A fair token is necessary but insufficient; cooperative
  time-slicing (or making GPU waits actually block) is the operative fix.

## 2026-06-02 (cont. 10) — ✅✅ BREAKTHROUGH: fair sched + per-frame yield → the VC-1 INTRO MOVIE DECODES (Step-1 validated); committed
Resumes cont.9. Env recovered, the per-frame yield built + tested. **The decoder was STARVED, not stuck** —
the fair scheduler + per-frame yield unstarves it and the movie decodes for the first time in variant A.
This overturns cont.6/cont.8's "stuck/gated, not merely starved" conclusion.

### Dev-env recovery — the REAL cause was a /tmp quota, not RAM
- cont.9 blamed RAM exhaustion. RAM was actually fine (16 GB free). The real cause: **`/tmp` is tmpfs with a
  per-user disk quota (`usrquota`, 12791 MB), and it was maxed out.** Two runaway debug dumps —
  `/tmp/movieopen_out.txt` (6.5 GB) + `/tmp/moviestart_out.txt` (5.6 GB) from cont.7 gdb sessions — filled the
  quota. The harness's own per-command `pwd >| /tmp/...cwd` write then failed → Bash returned exit 1 / no
  stdout. Fix: `rm` the two giant files (quota 12791→122 MB) → stdout capture restored immediately.
- Workaround used while diagnosing (before the fix): run Bash with the sandbox disabled + redirect output to a
  file outside /tmp (`> /home/h/_rexout.txt 2>&1`) and read it back. ⚠ Going forward: don't leave multi-GB
  dumps in /tmp; redirect big logs to the project dir or cap them.

### Build — cont.9's "unbuilt" was overcautious; the change WAS built
- `kernel.cpp.o` (13:43:37) + binary (13:43:38) were already newer than `kernel.cpp` (13:43:34), and the
  uncommitted diag strings (`sub_82250420 worker ENTERED`, `spurious g_tok.unlock`) were present in the binary.
  cont.9 marked it "unbuilt" because stdout broke before it could verify. Force-rebuilt anyway (clean, EXIT=0);
  confirmed the per-frame-yield override is compiled: `nm` shows `T sub_82167248` + `U __imp__sub_82167248`.

### Tests (all `timeout -s KILL`, /dev/shm cleaned each run)
1. **Default boot (no fair flags) — UNREGRESSED.** 109 664 lines/15 s, 12 068 VdGetSystemCommandBuffer + 12 269
   fence-forwards (healthy intro loop), **0** `initdiag`/`g_tok` lines (zero fair-mode leakage), no crash,
   **0** device-overwrite. The gating is clean by construction (default path is the unchanged g_waitMutex code).
2. **`REX_FAIRSCHED=1 REX_INITDIAG=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30` (no XFLAG) — scheduler fix works.** Threads that were
   token-starved forever now START + run: GuestThreadRun "GOT token" for tid=10 `sub_82250420` (×1),
   `sub_8211B740` ran (×1), and the VC-1 decoders `0x82339428/58/88` (×1 each). No crash, **0** device-overwrite,
   no FairMutex `[BUG]` (lock/unlock balanced). BUT `sub_8210AF90` did **NOT** run (0) → the 718-line
   `sub_8211B740` still diverges before it → transitions flag `0x828E82A6` stays 0 → intro does NOT auto-advance
   (fence head still climbing 17→39473 at 30 s). Exactly the cont.8-predicted *second* divergence (a logic gap
   inside sub_8211B740, not a scheduling gap).
3. **🎯 DECODER A/B (the decisive evidence) — `[video] LATE swap#220` frame-pool scan, same build, only
   REX_FAIRSCHED differs:**
   - Baseline (no fair): **all 16 buffers `nz=0 varied=0`** — uniform black, decoder produces nothing.
   - `REX_FAIRSCHED=1`: **buf4–11 carry real content**, `varied=8552 / 43090 / 64589 / 36729 / 56437 / 62655 /
     28047 / 13593`. By the diag's own criterion (adjacent-byte variation ⇒ decoding) the movie **IS decoding**.
   ⇒ The VC-1 decoder was **STARVED** by the cooperative single-token scheduler (main never yielded → decoder
   threads never got the token), **not stuck/gated**. The per-frame yield gives them the token and they decode.
   This is the first decoded movie content in variant A and validates the entire Step-1 (fibers/real-scheduler)
   theory that has been the leading root since cont.5.
4. **Determinism regression (the cont.9-flagged watch-item) — REX_FAIRSCHED ✗ REX_XFLAG.** The known-good cont.7
   combo `REX_XFLAG=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30` reaches attract (×2) + menu-setup in 161 311 lines/25 s; adding
   `REX_FAIRSCHED=1` STALLS it to **2 534 lines/25 s, attract=0** (never leaves intro; alive but ~64× slower,
   ending in a `[fencewait]`). So the fair object-waits are incompatible with the **forced** transition (matches
   the cont.8 band-aid regression). NOTE: REX_FAIRSCHED *alone* is fine (test 2 ran 42 k lines, intro loop
   alive) — the stall is specific to fair + REX_XFLAG. And it matters less now: REX_XFLAG was a stopgap for the
   *stuck-movie* problem that fair sched actually fixes; the path forward is the **natural** movie→EOF→advance,
   not XFLAG.

### Decision — COMMITTED (gated, default-safe, reversible, measured win)
- This is the prompt's "works → big Step-1 win" branch: the movie decodes. Committed the fair scheduler
  (`class FairMutex` FIFO run-token + fair object-waits in SignalObject/WaitObject/KeWaitForMultipleObjects/
  NtWaitForMultipleObjectsEx) + the per-frame cooperative yield at `sub_82167248` + the REX_INITDIAG worker-chain
  diag — all behind `REX_FAIRSCHED`/`REX_INITDIAG`, default boot untouched. Reversible (local, not pushed).

### Remaining blockers + NEXT
- **(a) `sub_8211B740` divergence** — even with tid=10 running, the 718-line handler doesn't reach
  `sub_8210AF90`, so `0x828E82A6` (transitions-enabled) is never set and the intro can't advance naturally.
  RE this divergence (it's state/data, not scheduling). This is the proper fix that retires REX_XFLAG.
- **(b) present the decoded frames** — the decoder now writes real frames to its pool (buf4–11). Wire the
  decoded surface to VdSwap/rex_render present → a VISIBLE intro movie (the decoded-frame shortcut, which cont.4
  abandoned only because there was no decoded frame; now there is).
- **(c)** make fair + forced-transition not stall (only if XFLAG is still wanted as a stopgap); lower priority
  than (a)/(b).
- ⚠ Do NOT combine REX_FAIRSCHED with REX_XFLAG (stalls). Use REX_FAIRSCHED with REX_MOVIE_EOF for decode work.

## 2026-06-02 (cont. 11) — ✅✅ THE DECODED INTRO MOVIE IS ON SCREEN (grayscale) — renderer increment 3: decoded-frame present
Resumes cont.10 (the movie now decodes). Implemented + verified the prompt's option **(b)** "present the
decoded frames": the host render thread now uploads the VC-1 luma plane and presents it via Vulkan, so the
intro movie is **VISIBLE for the first time in variant A**. Committed, gated behind REX_RENDER, default boot
unregressed. (User picked "both: present first, then RE" at the session fork.)

### Frame geometry — RE'd from the live decode dump
- Added **REX_VIDEODUMP**: the `[video]` LATE diag (swap#220) also fwrites each varied frame-pool buffer raw
  to `/tmp/vbufN.raw`. Reproduced cont.10 decode (`REX_FAIRSCHED=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`) → buf4–11 dumped.
- `ffprobe`: the movie is **1280×720 wmv3** (VC-1/WMV9). A full 720p YUV420 frame = 1,382,400 B but each pool
  buffer is only `0x101440` = 1,053,760 B (SMALLER → not full-res planar 420).
- Visualized the dump at candidate strides (numpy/PIL). Row-diff autocorrelation found a SHARP minimum at
  **stride 1344** (rowdiff 1.33 vs noise at 1280); rendering at 1344 → a perfectly clean, recognizable South
  Park intro frame (snowy mountains, pines, the town w/ RHINOPLASTY storefront, Cartman from behind).
  ⇒ **Y (luma) plane = LINEAR, pitch 1344 B, 1280×720 visible, offset 0, 8-bit.** (The earlier "dashes" at
  stride 1280 were a wrong-stride shear of sparse detail over a smooth sky gradient — not tiling.)
- Xenia 360 `GetTiledOffset2D` untiling made it WORSE (block-scramble) ⇒ the surface is NOT GPU-tiled, just
  plain linear with a padded pitch.
- **CHROMA still unresolved**: after Y (1344×720 = 967,680 B) only ~86 KB tail remains — too little for 420
  chroma (needs ~460 KB). Tail shows row-striped chroma-ish content; NV12/planar guesses gave wrong colors
  (magenta/green bands). Non-standard layout ⇒ deferred; presenting **grayscale (luma)** for now.

### Implementation (vulkan_render.cpp + rex_render.h + kernel.cpp), gated REX_RENDER
- `VdSwap` publishes `g_videoBufs[16]`+count to the render thread (`rex_render::PublishVideo`), INSIDE the
  existing `if (rex_render::Enabled())` block ⇒ **zero cost in default boot**. The render thread reads guest
  memory directly (`extern g_base`) and each present picks a CLEAN frame, expands its luma → a host-visible
  BGRA staging buffer (gray = Y,Y,Y,255) → `vkCmdCopyBufferToImage` into the swapchain image (no shaders).
- Frame SELECTION (the hard part — racing the decoder writing guest memory):
  - v1 "freshest changed buffer" → TEARING (read mid-decode: top new, bottom stale).
  - v2 "settled ≥2 presents" → still a black SEAM. The cooperative scheduler STALLS the decoder mid-frame, so
    a half-written buffer (black unwritten bands) looks settled. Proven with **REX_RENDER_DUMPSEL** (dump the
    exact selected guest buffer): rendered offline at 1344 it had black bands = partial decode.
  - v3 (final) "settled ≥2 presents AND complete": sample a 72×32 grid; a row whose mean luma ≤12 is an
    unwritten black band; require ≥69/72 rows written ⇒ display only fully-decoded frames → CLEAN full frame
    (min luma 43, no black bands, mean 152 = the offline frame). ✅ Screenshot delivered to user.
- Capture (`REX_RENDER_SHOT=N`) now triggers on the Nth DECODED frame (decouples from render/decode timing).

### Tests (all `timeout -s KILL`, /dev/shm cleaned each run)
1. `REX_RENDER=1 REX_FAIRSCHED=1`: window opens (RADV POLARIS11); decode kicks in (video buf selection valid,
   alternates complete buffers buf6/buf9); **0** device-overwrite; no crash. Captured a clean grayscale intro
   frame. Motion is present but SLOW — without REX_MOVIE_EOF the title advances slowly (guest swaps crawl to
   ~191/55s); that's a cooperative-throttle/perf matter, NOT a present-path bug.
2. **Default boot (no flags) UNREGRESSED**: **0** device-overwrite, no crash, **zero `[render]` lines**
   (renderer gated off), reaches the intro loop. Added per-VdSwap code is behind the REX_RENDER gate.

### NEXT
- **(a) COLOR**: RE the non-standard chroma layout in the buffer tail (or find the decoder's surface
  descriptor / a separate chroma plane) → YUV→RGB. The luma path + upload pipeline are already in place.
- **(b) Smooth MOTION**: the title advances slowly without REX_MOVIE_EOF (decoder cooperatively throttled);
  a faster scheduler / real blocking fence would speed playback (ties into Step 1).
- **(c)** [prompt option (a)] RE `sub_8211B740` divergence → natural intro→menu transition (retire REX_XFLAG).

Diagnostics added (all env-gated, default boot unregressed): REX_VIDEODUMP, REX_RENDER_DUMPSEL.
Build: `ninja -C runtime/out sp_td_varianta`. Visible movie:
`REX_RENDER=1 REX_FAIRSCHED=1 ./runtime/out/sp_td_varianta ../private/extracted/default.xex`.

### RE progress on path (a) — sub_8211B740 divergence (prod-oracle call chain captured)
After the present milestone, pivoted to the prompt's option (a) per the user. Findings (a START, multi-session):
- `sub_8210AF90` (sets the 0x828E82A6 transitions flag; teardown of app-object 0x828E8AF8) has **ZERO direct
  callers** in the whole variant-A recompiled image — it is reached ONLY via an indirect (vtable) dispatch.
- **Prod-oracle gdb backtrace at `__imp__sub_8210AF90`** (prod reaches it; variant A doesn't) gives the exact
  chain: `sub_82450FD0` (trampoline) → `sub_82250420` (tid=10 work-loop) → **`sub_8211B740`** → `sub_8210AF90`.
  In prod sub_8211B740 calls it directly at +0x1220; in variant A (XenonRecomp) the SAME call is one of the
  function's **7 indirect `PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC(ctr)` vtable calls** — which is why it's invisible statically.
  Run: `cd out/build/linux-amd64-release && SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. gdb -batch -x /tmp/oracle.gdb
  --args ./south_park_td --game_data_root=.../private/extracted --user_data_root=.../private/userdata
  --license_mask=1 --mnk_mode=true --always_win=true --window_width=960 --window_height=540` with a breakpoint
  on `__imp__sub_8210AF90` + `handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint pass`.
- `sub_8211B740` (720 C-lines, ppc_recomp.3.cpp:11035) structure: ~7 indirect vtable calls gated by ~6
  conditional branches (first at guest 0x8211B7A4: `beq` on `sub_8224FB68`'s return = a name/registry lookup;
  others at 0x8211B818 / 0x8211B8EC / 0x8211B9C0 / 0x8211B9AC / 0x8211BBE8). The divergence (cont.10: "state/
  data, not scheduling") is ONE of these branches going the wrong way in variant A (a failed lookup / unset
  state), skipping the vtable call that dispatches to sub_8210AF90.
- NEXT (to finish path a): instrument variant A's sub_8211B740 branch path (which loc_ labels it reaches under
  REX_FAIRSCHED, where tid=10 runs it) and diff against prod's path (gdb-step prod through sub_8211B740 to the
  sub_8210AF90 bctrl) → the first divergent branch + its state input is the fix target. Then RE that input
  (likely one of the sub_82248AF8 / sub_82108E20 / sub_82253540 / sub_8224FB68 lookups returning differently).

### ✅✅ COLOR DONE (cont.11, same session) — the intro movie now renders in FULL COLOR
After the grayscale present + the sub_8211B740 characterization, cracked the chroma and added color.
- **The chroma is a SEPARATE allocation, not in the Y buffer's tail.** The decoder's NtAllocateVirtualMemory
  log (LR 0x8244DD2C) shows a repeating TRIPLE per frame: **Y (req 0x101440)** then **U then V (req 0x40520
  each)** — planar I420. (My earlier "86KB tail" confusion was from dumping a fixed 0x101440 for every pool
  slot, which over-read the small chroma allocations. The 0x101440 buffer holds ONLY the Y plane + padding.)
- Pool order in g_videoBufs: Y at indices 0,3,6,9,12,15,18 (size 0x101440); its U = idx+1, V = idx+2 (0x40520).
- Chroma geometry from autocorrelation on the small buffers: **sharp stride minimum at 672 (= luma pitch/2),
  mean ≈128** ⇒ U/V are pitch 672, 640×360. Verified by rendering frame 2 (Y=buf6,U=buf7,V=buf8) → a correct
  vibrant frame (blue sky, green pines, Cartman's turquoise hat + red jacket). **Full-range BT.601**, U/V order
  = first-small=U, second-small=V (601 with that order gave correct colors; VU or 709 were wrong/off).
- Implementation: kernel.cpp captures base+size (g_videoBufSz[24]); PublishVideo passes both; the render thread
  selects only Y planes (size 0x101440), reads U/V from the next two slots, and does integer fixed-point
  YUV→RGB (full-range BT.601) on the CPU into the BGRA staging buffer (chroma upsampled 2× nearest). Same
  vkCmdCopyBufferToImage path, no shaders.
- Verified ON SCREEN: REX_RENDER=1 REX_FAIRSCHED=1 → captured frame has R≠G≠B (mean 134/160/158 = color),
  matches the offline proof, 0 device-overwrite, no crash. Default boot UNREGRESSED (0 [render], 0 overwrite).
  Screenshot delivered to user. ⇒ **Task (a) COLOR is DONE.** Remaining: (b) smooth motion (coop-throttle),
  (c) sub_8211B740 RE for the natural transition.

### Motion investigation (cont.11, task b) — the movie PLAYS but ~10× too slow (scheduler-bound)
Added a distinct-displayed-frame counter to the render thread. Decisive result (REX_RENDER=1 REX_FAIRSCHED=1,
55s): the count climbs steadily 15→28→41→…→126 — so playback **advances** (NOT stuck on ~2 frames; the
buf6↔buf9 alternation is just the decoder double-buffering into 2 Y slots whose CONTENTS change each frame).
But 126 distinct frames / 55s = **~2.3 movie-fps** vs the movie's 24 fps ≈ **10× too slow**, tracking the
guest's slow progress (~3.6 swaps/s without REX_MOVIE_EOF). Root: the cooperative single-token scheduler runs
ONE guest thread at a time, so the 4-thread VC-1 decoder can't use multiple cores → decode throughput starved.
No safe quick lever (the recompiled code assumes one-at-a-time execution; running decoder threads truly
concurrently would race/corrupt). ⇒ **smooth motion = the deep Step-1 real-concurrency scheduler**, multi-
session. (This refines cont.7's "stuck movie" to "slow movie": with REX_FAIRSCHED it genuinely plays through.)

## 2026-06-02 (cont.11, renderer) — user picked the FULL PM4→Vulkan renderer; foundation laid + critical blocker found
After the color movie, the user chose the full renderer (menu/gameplay content, not just the movie). Scoped
it and made the verifiable foundation; surfaced the gating blocker.

### ⛔ CRITICAL FINDING — the translator has NO real draws to consume in any reachable state
- With the movie now decoding (REX_FAIRSCHED), the intro STILL emits only `init=0x30088 numInd=3 prim=8`
  draws (single untextured rects, 8/frame via REX_SEGCP), ZERO bound textures. The movie quad is NOT a PM4
  draw in variant A — prod presents it via the scaler/overlay path (the SpMovie 3-plane YUV shader, see
  below); our decoded-frame CPU present already replicates that.
- The FORCED transition (REX_XFLAG=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30 REX_SKIPINTRO=1) toward attract/menu ALSO emits only
  the same untextured rects (80/80) + ZERO textures, and hits INDIRECT-NULL blockers (target=0x0 @
  lr=0x82292D08; target=0x82367BD8 @ lr=0x8236859C; plus the known sub_8215DE84). ⇒ the real textured PM4
  draws are gated behind the screen-setup INDIRECT-NULL blockers — reaching a LIVE menu/gameplay screen
  (deep, title-specific RE) is the PREREQUISITE for the renderer to have anything to translate.
- ⇒ The renderer splits into (1) the shader/pipeline toolchain (verifiable in isolation — done below) and
  (2) the draw-state translator (BLOCKED on real draws until the screen progression is unblocked).

### ✅ Shader toolchain — DE-RISKED and built (varianta/tools/shaderc/)
- Confirmed the 19 `.updb` carry ORIGINAL D3D9 HLSL (ps_3_0) + interpolator/constant/sampler metadata.
  All 19 are PIXEL shaders (.psh); vertex shaders are only `.xbv` (compiled) → the renderer will use
  handwritten generic VS per vertex layout.
- libshaderc is installed (`libshaderc_shared.so.1`, no dev pkg). Wrote `compile.cpp` (GLSL→SPIR-V, declares
  the shaderc C API inline) + `build.sh`. Ported 5 shaders to Vulkan GLSL covering every pattern and compiled
  them to VALID SPIR-V (magic 0x07230203): Simple/SPTextured (tex*color, s0), SPUntextured (vertex color),
  SimpleCol (color*matCol push-const), **SpMovie (3 samplers Y/U/V → YUV→RGB studio-range BT.601 — the
  movie-quad shader)**. The remaining 14 are mechanical variants. Port map: `sampler2D`+`tex2D`→`texture()`,
  `:COLOR`/`:TEXCOORD` interpolators→`layout(location=<.updb Register>)`, `sN`→`set=0,binding=N`,
  `uniform floatN`→push constant.

### NEXT (renderer, by dependency order)
1. **Unblock the screen progression** (THE prerequisite for real draws): RE the INDIRECT-NULL screen-setup
   blockers (sub_8215DE84 / 0x82292D08 / 0x8236859C) and/or the natural transition (sub_8211B740) so the
   title reaches a live menu screen that emits textured PM4 draws.
2. **Draw-state translator**: once real draws flow (REX_SEGCP already captures the segment IBs), decode per
   draw: vertex fetch constants (reg 0x4800) → vertex buffers + layout; ALU constants (reg 0x4000) →
   uniforms; bound textures (reg 0x4800) → VkImage (detile + format); render target / viewport regs. Build a
   VkPipeline (ported PS + generic VS) and vkCmdDraw into the swapchain image (the render thread already owns
   it). Verify against the menu.
3. **Port the remaining 14 shaders**; add generic vertex shaders; texture upload/detile.

### sub_8211B740 divergence — NARROWED (cont.11, REX_TRACEB740) to the mid-section direct calls
Toward unblocking the screen progression (the renderer's prerequisite), traced sub_8211B740's indirect calls.
Added REX_TRACEB740: PPCInvokeGuest logs every bctrl whose call-site LR ∈ [0x8211B748,0x8211C000) (i.e. from
sub_8211B740) with its return value (the post-bctrl branches gate on it). Gated, default boot unregressed.
- Result (REX_FAIRSCHED=1, tid=10 runs sub_8211B740): it makes EXACTLY 2 indirect calls, both returning
  NORMAL values, then never reaches any later bctrl (the sub_8210AF90 dispatch never fires):
  - `0x8211B7D4 -> 0x82118E10 ret=0x1` (the first loop body; loop ran once, r31=1).
  - `0x8211B804 -> 0x82248F18 ret=0x0133F260` (a vtable[1] call returning a VALID pointer).
- The branch right after the 2nd bctrl (`beq 0x8211B818` on r3==0) therefore goes the EXPECTED non-zero way
  (calls sub_8211BC40, stores the ptr at [r30+64]). So the early part is FINE — the divergence is DEEPER, in
  the direct-call init section after 0x8211B814 (sub_82131758 / sub_8213E7E8 / sub_82132918 / sub_8212BE48 /
  sub_8211BD60 ...), which my indirect-only trace can't see, BEFORE the later sub_8210AF90 indirect dispatch.
- NEXT (to finish): trace those direct calls (gdb breakpoints on the mid-section callees filtered to the
  sub_8211B740 invocation, or temporary fprintf in the recompiled body) to find the one that hangs/returns-
  early/diverges; compare to prod. The 2 early bctrls + their returns are now the verified-good prefix.

### ⭐ sub_8211B740 "divergence" ROOT-CAUSED (cont.11) — it's STARVATION, not a code divergence (UNIFIES with slow movie)
Continued the natural-transition RE with gdb on the live boot (REX_FAIRSCHED REX_MOVIE_EOF=30 REX_TRACEB740).
Decisive chain of evidence:
- sub_8211B740 makes EXACTLY 2 indirect calls (0x82118E10→1, 0x82248F18→valid ptr) over an 85s run and NEVER
  reaches the later sub_8210AF90 dispatch (the 0x828E82A6 setter).
- gdb backtrace of the worker tid=10: it IS executing sub_8211B740, grinding in its heavy SIMD init chain
  `sub_82132918 (call site 0x8211B854) → sub_8212F6F0 → sub_822C14E8` — a vector matrix/transform loop
  (vperm/vpermwi/float-adds, stvewx128 to strided addrs). Samples show it at different lines (11190, 11195)
  across time ⇒ PROGRESSING, not hung on a sync (top frame = simde_mm_shuffle_epi8, pure compute).
- ⭐ PER-THREAD CPU (`ps -L`): ONLY the main thread burns CPU (82%); tid=10 and the other 12 threads are ~0%.
  ⇒ sub_822C14E8 is NOT an infinite/busy loop — tid=10 is STARVED. The main thread's fence-forward makes its
  GPU waits instant, so it holds the cooperative token ~continuously; the worker's heavy one-shot init gets
  near-zero CPU and barely advances → never finishes → never reaches sub_8210AF90 → 0x828E82A6 stays 0.
- ⇒ This OVERTURNS cont.8/cont.10's "sub_8211B740 diverges (state/data)" — it is NOT a code divergence. It is
  the SAME cooperative-scheduler starvation as the slow movie (worker/decoder threads starved by the
  CPU-bound main thread). The per-frame yield (cont.10) gives the decoders enough for slow decode but NOT
  enough for the worker's heavy SIMD init.
- ⇒ FIX (unified, deep): Step-1 real scheduler (true concurrency) OR replace the fence-forward stopgap with a
  REAL blocking fence so the main thread BLOCKS on GPU waits and yields CPU to the worker + decoders. Either
  makes sub_8211B740 finish → natural transition AND smooth movie. REX_XFLAG stays the stopgap meanwhile.
  This is THE Step-1 item; it gates both the natural intro→menu transition (→ real draws for the renderer)
  and smooth playback. Next concrete sub-task: prototype a real blocking fence (replace fence-forward in the
  ~6 sub_821B9270 waiters) and re-measure per-thread CPU + whether sub_8210AF90 fires.

## 2026-06-03 (cont. 12) — true concurrency (REX_NOTOKEN) made to BOOT; scheduler is NOT the root blocker (overturns cont.11)
Resumed at HEAD=4555fb8 with the prior session's UNTESTED `BlockFenceYield` (REX_BLOCKFENCE) prototype in the
working tree. Tested it, then pivoted to true concurrency. Decisive results:

### 1) `BlockFenceYield` (REX_BLOCKFENCE) — DISPROVEN (the cont.11 planned "blocking fence" next-step)
- The prototype cedes a FIFO run-token round at the fence-forward sites, intending to un-starve the workers.
- A/B per-thread CPU (REX_FAIRSCHED vs +REX_BLOCKFENCE=0 vs =50): **IDENTICAL** — one thread 99%, all others
  ~0%, total still 100% (one core). With =50µs the total CPU did NOT drop ⇒ the cede barely fires.
- Why: (a) the fence-forward (sub_821C6E58/sub_821C5DF0) runs only ~per-frame (around present), NOT in the hot
  intro loop (VdGetSystemCommandBuffer ×thousands), so BlockFenceYield ≈ the EXISTING per-frame yield; (b) gdb
  thread-state map (REX_FAIRSCHED): the workers/decoders are blocked in `g_objCv.wait` (FairWaitUntil:820 —
  waiting for a guest OBJECT to be signaled), NOT in the `g_tok` run-token queue. Ceding the run-token is a
  no-op when nobody is waiting for the token. ⇒ removed BlockFenceYield from the tree.

### 2) The cooperative single-token serializes ALL guest threads onto ONE core (root of the 10× slow movie)
- gdb (cooperative, REX_FAIRSCHED): the token DOES circulate (caught a VC-1 decoder sub_82339458 mid-decode
  holding it, main blocked at the per-frame yield), but only one runs at a time. 4 decoders + main + tid=10
  share one core ⇒ ~10× slow. This is inherent to the cooperative model, not a fairness bug.

### 3) REX_NOTOKEN (preemptive / true concurrency) was HALF-IMPLEMENTED — fixed 2 bugs, now BOOTS
- Out of the box REX_NOTOKEN dead-locked at **124 lines**. Two bugs (both default-safe — the cooperative path
  is byte-identical; only the REX_NOTOKEN branch changes):
  - **Fix #1 — GuestThreadRun token hold.** `GuestThreadRun` did `if (g_fair) g_tok.lock(); else g_waitMutex.lock();`
    with NO `g_coop` guard (unlike `LockGuestExecution`). Under NOTOKEN it held g_waitMutex for the thread's
    whole lifetime, so a spawned thread re-locking it inside `WaitObject` self-deadlocked (non-recursive mutex).
    Gated it `else if (g_coop)`. → boot **124 → 1387 lines, reaches VdSwap #1**.
  - **Fix #2 — fence-forward gate.** The forward overrides (sub_821C6E58/sub_821C5DF0) were wrapped in
    `if (g_coop)`, so under NOTOKEN the GPU-fence-spin (sub_821B9270) was never satisfied → a spawned thread
    span forever in sub_821C6E58→sub_821B9270 while main blocked on NtWaitForSingleObjectEx waiting for it
    (gdb-confirmed). Added `g_preempt = !g_coop` and gated the forward `if (g_coop || g_preempt)`. → boot
    **1387 → 369750 lines** (≈2× past the default cooperative boot), reaches the steady per-frame intro loop.
- **TRUE CONCURRENCY CONFIRMED:** per-thread CPU under NOTOKEN = **2 threads at ~99% (total 199%)** — two host
  cores running guest code simultaneously (the cooperative token can never exceed ~100%). No crash (segv=0),
  and the **default cooperative boot is UNREGRESSED** (57k non-spam lines/22s, 0 device-overwrite, reaches intro).

### 4) ⭐ But concurrency does NOT unblock the movie or the transition — they are BLOCKED-WAITING, not CPU-starved
This OVERTURNS cont.11's "starvation" diagnosis. Under true concurrency, with their own cores available:
- **Movie**: the VC-1 decoder threads (sub_82339428→…→KeWaitForSingleObject) sit BLOCKED in object-waits at
  ~0% CPU, and the frame pool is uniform/black at swap#220 (`[video]` varied=0 for all Y/UV buffers) — i.e. NOT
  decoding. (Cooperative-FAIRSCHED, cont.10, DID decode: buf4-11 varied=8552..64589. The per-frame yield there
  happened to drive the decode; NOTOKEN's free-running threads leave the decoder blocked on a signal/input that
  never comes.) ⚠ swap#220 arrives at ~11 s under NOTOKEN (main runs ~5-6× faster on its own core), so "black at
  swap#220" is partly an early sample — but the gdb-confirmed object-blocked decoders are the stronger signal.
- **Transition**: tid=10 (sub_8211B740) under concurrency progresses FURTHER than cont.11 (it gets PAST the
  sub_82132918→sub_822C14E8 SIMD section cont.11 thought was the wall) and then BLOCKS deeper, at
  sub_8211B740→sub_8212BE48→…→sub_82427858→sub_82435C48 (~0% CPU = a wait, not a spin). It still never reaches
  sub_8210AF90 (0x828E82A6 stays 0) even after 90 s with a full dedicated core. So sub_8211B740 is gated on an
  object/condition variant A doesn't satisfy, NOT on CPU.
- ⇒ **CONCLUSION:** the cooperative scheduler made the decoder + tid=10 LOOK CPU-starved, but with full
  concurrency they are revealed as BLOCKED on missing signals / unmet state — deeper title-specific RE problems.
  The scheduler is NOT the root blocker for either the movie or the natural transition. REX_NOTOKEN is a real
  infrastructure milestone (true concurrency now boots, default-safe) and likely the right long-term base, but
  it does not by itself produce a smoother movie or the natural intro→menu transition.

### Committed (default-safe, NOT pushed): the 2 NOTOKEN fixes + BlockFenceYield removal.
### NEXT (deep, title-specific RE — pick one; awaiting user):
- (a) Why do the VC-1 decoder threads stay blocked on their object-waits under NOTOKEN? (what input/signal —
  demux feed, buffer-ready event, 4-thread decode handshake — are they waiting for that variant A never posts?)
- (b) What does tid=10's new blocker sub_82435C48 wait for? (the deeper transition gate, past the SIMD init).
- (c) Keep the renderer on the REX_XFLAG forced-transition path (reach a menu screen for real draws) and treat
  the scheduler/movie as a separate track.
- Diag this session (all gated/reversible): per-thread CPU + gdb thread-state scripts; `[video]` swap#220 dump.

### cont.12 (b) — natural-transition RE under true concurrency (user-picked direction b): tid=10 hangs on an ORPHANED critical section; releasing it advances intro→menu, converging with the INDIRECT-NULL renderer blockers
With REX_NOTOKEN booting, pursued WHY tid=10 (sub_8211B740) still never reaches sub_8210AF90.
- **gdb full stack of tid=10**: it is BLOCKED in `RtlEnterCriticalSection` (std::recursive_mutex) at
  sub_8211B740→…→sub_82434860→**sub_82435C48** — waiting on a guest CRITICAL SECTION, NOT a CPU spin (~0% CPU).
  Reading the host mutex (`__owner`): the owning LWP has ALREADY EXITED ⇒ an **ORPHANED critical section**
  (std::recursive_mutex is not auto-released on thread exit, so a later RtlEnterCriticalSection deadlocks).
- **REX_CSLEAK diagnostic** (track per-host-thread held CSes; on GuestThreadRun exit warn/release) named the
  culprit, exactly one event: `[CS-LEAK] guest thread start=0x8242B4A8 EXITED owning CS=0x82818628`.
  sub_8242B4A8 = the GPU/video-init thread (sub_8242B4A8→sub_8214F730→fence-wait sub_821C6E58); it acquires
  CS 0x82818628, does GPU init, and EXITS without releasing it — its RtlLeaveCriticalSection branch is skipped
  because the fence-forward stopgap doesn't reproduce the real GPU sequence, so it diverges. Under the
  cooperative token this never surfaces (one thread at a time); under NOTOKEN tid=10 contends and deadlocks.
- **Fix (NOTOKEN-gated, default-safe)**: when a guest thread exits, release any CS it still holds (it owns
  those host mutexes, and it returned normally so the guarded state is consistent). Result: tid=10 UNBLOCKS
  and the title **ADVANCES OUT OF THE INTRO into MENU/FRONTEND setup** — loads `Global/Textures/Global.bin`
  (28165 B) + allocs menu buffers (NEW activity: NtQueryDirectoryFile, KeQueryBasePriorityThread, a flood of
  RtlInitializeCriticalSection from sub_82427xxx). **Concrete progress toward the renderer.** Then a CASCADE
  of `[INDIRECT-NULL]` (null vtable/jump-table slots: 0x82292D08, 0x8236859C, **0x821BF834, 0x821C71A4**) →
  **SIGSEGV at ~34s**.
- ⭐ **CONVERGENCE (directions b + c):** the natural path reaches the SAME menu-setup INDIRECT-NULL blockers
  as the forced REX_XFLAG path (cont.11: 0x82292D08 / 0x8236859C / sub_8215DE84). The NEW INDIRECT-NULLs are
  in the **0x821Bxxxx / 0x821Cxxxx CP/render code** ⇒ the menu tries to RENDER through GPU vtables variant A
  has not populated (no real CP/renderer) → the **renderer is THE blocker for a live menu**. (Note: sub_8210AF90
  STILL never fires — the advance happens via a different path under NOTOKEN, so the cont.7/8 "0x828E82A6 via
  sub_8210AF90" model is not the only route to leave the intro.)
- ⇒ Both ways of reaching the menu converge on **INDIRECT-NULL screen/GPU-vtable recovery (= the renderer
  work)**. NOTOKEN + the orphan-CS release get the title there NATURALLY (no REX_XFLAG).
- **Committed (NOTOKEN-gated, default-safe):** REX_CSLEAK diagnostic + orphaned-CS release-on-exit. Default
  cooperative boot unregressed (VdSwap, 0 device-overwrite). The ~34s SIGSEGV (render-vtable INDIRECT-NULL
  cascade) is the next frontier — the renderer.
- NEXT: recover the INDIRECT-NULL screen/GPU vtables (sub_8215DE84 / 0x82292D08 / 0x8236859C / 0x821BF834 /
  0x821C71A4) so the menu builds real textured PM4 draws → the draw-state translator has content. This is the
  renderer (RENDERER-PHASE-PLAN), now reachable via the natural NOTOKEN path.

### cont.12 (c) — INDIRECT-NULL menu/renderer recovery STARTED via the prod oracle (user-picked)
With NOTOKEN+CS-fix reaching menu setup, classified the INDIRECT-NULL cascade with REX_INDDUMP (per distinct
null call-site: dump GPRs + the C++ vtable chain), then read the CORRECT values from the prod oracle.

INDIRECT-NULL site classification (REX_INDDUMP):
- ROOT — lr=0x82292D08 in sub_82292CE0: a C++ VIRTUAL CALL on a NULL global singleton. The recomp does
  `obj=*(r31+4); obj->vtable->method[1]()` with r31=0x827FD568 (a fixed image global). Dump: *(r31+4)=
  *(0x827FD56C)=0 — the singleton is NEVER CONSTRUCTED in variant A → the virtual call targets null.
- 4 sites (lr 0x8236859C / 0x823685D0 / 0x82368070 / 0x82368160) all target 0x82367BD8 = a MISSING JUMP
  TABLE in sub_82367B88 (switch on r3=0..11; table base 0x82367BA8 [lis 0x8209<<16 + 0x7BA8], default
  0x82367C50, case code starts 0x82367BD8). XenonAnalyse missed it and emitted the switch `bctr` as an
  indirect call. It is one of the BOUNDARY-LIMITED cases — the 0x82367BA8 table DATA was mis-split into a
  function sub_82367BA8 — so recovering it needs the function-boundary fix, not just a toml add.
- 3 sites (sub_825ABxxx, target 0x0): registers hold ASCII path fragments + *(r3)=0xB4B4B4B4 (uninit fill)
  = DOWNSTREAM corruption (a symptom of the incomplete menu state), not a root.

PROD ORACLE (gdb prod; guest base FIXED at 0x100000000; at a recomp fn entry rsi=base [SysV ABI 2nd arg],
r31=0x827FD568 const; symbols present, not stripped):
- At sub_82292CE0: global 0x827FD56C = obj 0x45FE78B0 (a heap object), *obj = vtable 0x820948B0 (static, in
  the image), vt[0]=0x8248E768, vt[1]=0x824927B8 (the method variant A wants). Prod caller path:
  main → sub_82249970 → sub_82150770 → sub_82292CE0 (the frontend/menu setup). ⇒ variant A reaches the same
  virtual call but with the singleton 0x827FD56C UNCONSTRUCTED — root confirmed via the oracle.
- Constructor of the singleton: a hardware-watchpoint on host 0x182FD56C (= prod base + 0x827FD56C) is the
  method (find the code that allocs obj 0x45FE78B0-class + sets vtable 0x820948B0 + stores it at 0x827FD56C);
  first try via a stop()-callback failed (software fallback / arming-in-callback), retried top-level.
Committed: REX_INDDUMP (7f901e9). Tooling: prod base=0x100000000, $rsi=base, r31 const; /tmp/prod_oracle.gdb
(read object/vtable) + /tmp/prod_ctor2.gdb (watchpoint the constructor).
NEXT: identify the singleton's constructor + why variant A skips it (an upstream menu-init divergence,
likely the same fence-forward/GPU-init lineage), then recover so sub_82292CE0's virtual call succeeds and the
menu builds real textured PM4 draws → the draw-state translator (the renderer). The jump table sub_82367B88
is a separate boundary-limited recovery.

### cont.12 (c, cont.) — singleton constructor chain found; the menu KICKS REAL GPU WORK (ring alive); SIGSEGV is a gfx-interrupt null-vtable
Traced the 0x820948B0-class constructor STATICALLY (no flaky watchpoint): the vtable 0x820948B0 is set ONLY
by sub_824883E0 (`lis 0x8209 + addi 0x48B0; stw r11,0(this)`), called only by the construct-wrapper
sub_824898C0, called only by the lazy getter sub_8248F4C8 (allocs, constructs, caches the object at a DIFFERENT
global 0x82819358 via `stw r31,-27816(r25)` r25=0x82820000; returns it), called only by sub_8248F988. So the
0x827FD56C the virtual call reads is a SEPARATE reference (a manager at 0x827FD568 holding the object at +4),
populated by a caller of the getter, not the getter's own cache.
- ⭐ varianta hit-check (gdb, NOTOKEN+CS-fix, breakpoints on the chain): the getter sub_8248F4C8 IS reached
  (1 hit) but the constructor sub_824883E0 AND the construct-wrapper sub_824898C0 are NEVER called (0 hits).
  ⇒ in variant A the getter runs but its lazy-init branch SKIPS construction (or a different construct path
  is never reached), so the 0x820948B0-class object is never built and 0x827FD56C stays null → the
  sub_82292CE0 virtual call hits null. The recovery target = why the construction branch is skipped.
- ⭐⭐ The ~34s SIGSEGV is NOT the null singleton directly — and it reveals a BIG step: under NOTOKEN+CS-fix the
  menu loads real assets (Global/Textures + Global/Meshes/Global.bin) and **KICKS REAL GPU WORK — the main
  ring is ALIVE** (was frozen at WPTR=37 the whole intro). The crash stack: VblankPump → ExecuteRing(rptr=37
  wptr=...) → ExecutePM4 → ExecuteType3(op=0x54 EVENT_WRITE) → FireGfxInterrupt(cb,source=1) →
  sub_821C7170 → `PPC_STORE_U32(r31+0,...)` with r31 GARBAGE → SIGSEGV. sub_821C7170 is itself an INDIRECT-NULL
  site (0x821C71A4, target=0x003F8000 = a garbage method pointer in r10): the skipped indirect call leaves r31
  garbage, so the next store faults. ⇒ a downstream null/garbage vtable in the graphics-interrupt callback path
  the CP now exercises (because the menu emits PM4 EVENT_WRITE that fires the gfx interrupt).
- NET: directions (b)+(c) have driven variant A from a frozen intro to a MENU that loads assets and emits real
  GPU work — the renderer now has live PM4 to process. The remaining blockers are a cluster of uninitialised
  menu/GPU objects (null singleton 0x827FD56C via skipped construction; the gfx-interrupt callback's garbage
  vtable in sub_821C7170; the missing jump table sub_82367B88), all surfacing because variant A's menu/GPU
  subsystem init diverges (the same lineage as the fence-forward stopgap / no real CP). Each is a concrete,
  separately-recoverable target. Diag REX_INDDUMP + prod-oracle method (base 0x100000000, rsi=base, r31 const).

### cont.12 (c2) — ROOT of the menu null-singleton: ExAllocatePoolTypeWithTag was a NULL stub; implemented the kernel pool allocator
Traced the singleton-construction failure all the way down (gdb FinishBreakpoints on the chain return values):
getter sub_8248F4C8 (cache *(0x82819358)=0 ⇒ it DOES take the construct path, not the already-cached error
path) → sub_82497720 (CS+refcount) → sub_82497678 → sub_824A5E50 (calls a static allocator object's vtable[0]
sub_824A5DD0) → sub_824A5DD0 → **ExAllocatePoolTypeWithTag** → returned **0x8007000E (E_OUTOFMEMORY)**. Because
ExAllocatePoolTypeWithTag / ExAllocatePoolWithTag / ExFreePool were weak stubs returning NULL, EVERY guest
kernel-pool allocation failed → the singleton manager object was never built → 0x827FD56C stayed null → the
menu virtual-called through it = the whole INDIRECT-NULL cascade + SIGSEGV. (sub_824A5DD0: `mr r3,r4; lis/ori
r4=tag 0x4E574D20; li r5,0; b ExAllocatePoolTypeWithTag` ⇒ ABI r3=NumberOfBytes, r4=Tag, r5=PoolType.)
- **FIX (kernel.cpp, NOT gated — a real kernel primitive):** implemented ExAllocatePoolTypeWithTag(size r3,
  tag r4, type r5) + ExAllocatePoolWithTag (Xbox 360 2-arg, size-first) + ExFreePool (no-op leak) as a
  fine-grained 16-byte-aligned bump allocator over >=8 MiB arenas carved from the guest VM cursor g_virtNext
  (tracked in g_regions; every block is fresh demand-zero guest memory).
- **RESULT:** the singleton constructor NOW RUNS (sub_824883E0 / sub_824898C0: 0→1 hits). The menu progresses
  much further: it now loads its RENDERING ASSETS — **shaders SPBackdropTextured.xbp / SpTextured.xbv+.xbp,
  textures LipSyncTextures.bin / Global.bin** (the frontend setting up its draw pipeline). The SIGSEGV MOVED
  FORWARD: was sub_821C7170 (gfx-interrupt) → now sub_82368028 ← sub_8233DFD0 ← sub_8233E198 (the menu/UI
  region near the still-missing jump table sub_82367B88). Default cooperative boot UNREGRESSED (ALIVE, VdSwap,
  0 device-overwrite, 0 segv; the [stub] ExAllocatePoolType line is gone — the override is live).
- ⇒ ExAllocatePoolTypeWithTag was a FUNDAMENTAL missing primitive — implementing it unblocks ALL menu pool
  allocations at once (cluster item 1 RESOLVED). NEXT = the new crash at sub_82368028 (cluster items 2/3: the
  missing jump table sub_82367B88 and/or the gfx-interrupt null-vtable sub_821C7170).

### cont.12 (c3) — past the pool fix the menu hits a NOTOKEN+stub-CP concurrency swamp (gfx-interrupt + string-as-code corruption)
With the pool allocator unblocking the menu, the next crashes are RACE-DEPENDENT under NOTOKEN (the host
VblankPump CP thread fires GPU interrupts / re-runs the ring concurrently with the menu's GPU-setup thread):
- **gfx-interrupt crash (sub_821C7170, recurs on the VblankPump thread):** our CP, on a menu PM4_INTERRUPT
  (op 0x54), calls FireGfxInterrupt(source=1). The source=1 (command-buffer-complete) handler sub_821C7170
  derefs the device's active completion object at *(device+10900) and clears the firing CPU's ack bit. The
  title sets that field per submission (sub_821C73D8) and leaves it the sentinel 0xFFFFFFFF between
  submissions; variant A's CP fires the interrupt when none is pending → deref of 0xFFFFFFFF (last byte of
  the 4 GiB map) → SIGSEGV. STOPGAP guard added in FireGfxInterrupt: skip source=1 when *(device+10900)==
  0xFFFFFFFF (nothing to acknowledge). Default boot unregressed; the gfx-interrupt crash is gone.
- BUT the title still dies ~32s at a DIFFERENT spot: an INDIRECT-NULL cascade at lr=0x82204D08 whose targets
  are ASCII PATH FRAGMENTS (0x67616D65="game", 0x41737365="Asse", 0x74735C47="ts\G") — sub_82204xxx is
  executing a path STRING as a function/vtable table = downstream corruption (same class as the earlier
  sub_825AB garbage). The menu's state is inconsistent: a buffer that should hold pointers holds a path string.
- ⇒ Past the (clean) pool-allocator win, the menu bring-up is a CLUSTER of variant-A-specific concurrency +
  uninitialised-object issues: (a) NOTOKEN guest-thread races; (b) the VblankPump host CP firing GPU
  interrupts / re-running the ring asynchronously vs the guest's GPU submission; (c) string-as-code
  corruption from incomplete menu state; (d) the still-missing jump table sub_82367B88. This is the
  renderer / CP-concurrency boundary — fixing crashes one-by-one under NOTOKEN races is whack-a-mole; the
  structural fix is a properly-synchronised CP (the renderer work). The pool allocator + gfx-interrupt guard
  are committed correct stopgaps that advanced the menu to loading its shaders; the rest needs the CP/render
  architecture. Diag REX_INDDUMP; run REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1.

### cont.12 (c4) — CP synchronization (g_gpuMutex) fixes the pump-races-guest crash; the menu now reaches its RENDER code = the renderer boundary
USER picked the structural fix (synchronize the CP). ROOT of the race class: the VblankPump is a HOST thread
that runs ExecuteRing + the gfx-interrupt CALLBACK (guest code); under the cooperative token it is serialized
with the guest, but under NOTOKEN the pump's `if(g_fair)…else if(g_coop)…` acquires NOTHING -> it races every
guest thread.
- FIX (g_gpuMutex, NOTOKEN-only, default path untouched): the pump holds g_gpuMutex over its ExecuteRing +
  FireGfxInterrupt batch; the guest's GPU-boundary functions hold it too — the ring kick sub_821C6600 and the
  completion-object setup sub_821C73D8 (which writes the device+10900 the source=1 handler derefs). This
  serializes the host pump with the guest GPU submission WITHOUT a global run-token (decoders/menu logic stay
  concurrent; recursive mutex for callback re-entry). No deadlock; default boot UNREGRESSED.
- RESULT: the gfx-interrupt crash (sub_821C7170, pump-races-guest) is GONE from the cascade. The title
  progresses INTO its render code and now SIGSEGVs ~33s on INDIRECT-NULLs in the 0x821Bxxxx/0x821Cxxxx GPU/CP
  region whose targets are FLOAT values (0x43A04000=320.5f, 0x421A0000=38.5f, 0x3E340000=0.176f) — i.e. the
  title's render code is reading VERTEX / render-state data as function pointers, because variant A's stub CP
  maintains no real GPU draw-state.
- ⇒ ⭐ THE MENU HAS REACHED THE RENDERER BOUNDARY. The chain of this session's fixes drove it there naturally
  (no REX_XFLAG): pool allocator -> the singleton constructs -> the menu loads its shaders/textures; CP-sync
  -> the pump no longer races the guest -> the menu reaches its actual RENDERING; and rendering needs the real
  GPU draw-state that only a PM4->Vulkan renderer maintains. This UNIFIES with cont.11: the renderer
  (draw-state translator: vfetch reg0x4800 -> vertex buffers + layout, ALU reg0x4000 -> uniforms, textures,
  RT/viewport; + the 19 .updb shaders -> SPIR-V; vkCmdDraw into the swapchain the render thread owns) is THE
  remaining work — now reachable through the NATURAL menu (pool + CS-fix + NOTOKEN + CP-sync), not the forced
  REX_XFLAG path. Committed correct stopgaps this session: pool allocator (724c104), gfx-interrupt guard +
  g_gpuMutex CP-sync. Run: REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 -> menu (shaders) -> render-code SIGSEGV ~33s.

### cont.12 (c5) — draw-state translator START blocked on INPUT: only init rects reach the CP (the cont.11 coverage problem, confirmed in the menu)
USER picked the renderer (draw-state translator). PREREQ check — what DRAW_INDX/state actually reaches the CP
during the menu? REX_DRAWLOG (main ring) and REX_SEGCP (route B) both during the NOTOKEN+CS-fix menu:
- 60 draws via the main ring, 120 via route B — ALL `init=0x30088 numInd=3 prim=8` (the same degenerate
  RECT_LIST as the intro), ZERO bound textures. The menu's REAL textured draws do NOT reach the CP.
- ⇒ same COVERAGE PROBLEM as cont.11 (b22fe28): the title builds its real draws in its CUSTOM deferred
  command-buffer pool (device+13568, growing ~0x88680/frame: PM4 interleaved with INLINE VERTEX floats +
  0x8100xxxx segment-link descriptors; cont.11 REX_CHUNKCP linear-parse DESYNCED on it). They never reach the
  main ring (only the 6 init kicks) or the route-B segment scan. The CP's existing SET_CONSTANT(0x4000 ALU /
  0x4800 fetch+tex) + DRAW_INDX plumbing is ready, but it has no real draw to translate.
- So the draw-state translator cannot START until the real draws reach the CP. PREREQUISITE options:
  (A) crack the title's deferred cmd-buffer format (device+13568) and execute its chunks correctly (follow the
      segment links / the 0x38/0x79 ops, skip the inline-vertex regions) — the direct path to the real draws,
      cont.11's "full cmd-buffer enumeration (hard)";
  (B) intercept the title's draw-RECORD function (where it emits a DRAW_INDX into its cmd-buffer with the GPU
      regs live) and translate at the source — bypasses the cmd-buffer format but needs to find that fn;
  (C) drive the title's own flush sub_821C6D58 to push the built IBs to the ring (route A — but cont.11 showed
      the title is NOT fence-gated, so this premise is weak).
  (Separately, the menu still SIGSEGVs ~33s — a stability blocker, but device+13568 grows regardless, so the
  draws ARE being built; the blocker is extraction, not the crash.)
- ⇒ The renderer's true first step is the deferred-cmd-buffer extraction (A or B), not the Vulkan translation
  (which is plumbed + the shaders are ported). This is the cont.11-unresolved hard RE, now scoped to the menu.

### cont.12 (c6) — draw-record interception (user-picked): finding the draw fn — random prod sampling too noisy
USER picked: intercept the title's draw-record function (hook where it emits a DRAW_INDX, translate at the
source, bypassing the deferred cmd-buffer format). Step 1 = find that function.
- Tried RANDOM prod-thread sampling (gdb `thread apply all bt` ×3 during the menu): too noisy — the histogram
  is dominated by BLOCKED threads in waits (workers sub_8230FA80/sub_8230E898, GPU-sync sub_821CC5D0/
  sub_821BFF48, decoders sub_82339xxx, the trampoline sub_82450FD0) + the screen-loop (sub_82249678/970/AD0,
  sub_82150970). A draw call is fast and was not caught; prod at the static menu draws infrequently.
- NEXT (targeted, reliable): find the draw-record fn by INSTRUMENTING variant A's own cmd-buffer writes — the
  title records DRAW_INDX_2 (op 0x36) packets into device+13568's current chunk; hook the cmd-buffer reserve/
  write (the fn that advances *(device+13568+4) writeptr, cont.11-mapped) and log the guest LR when an op-0x36
  header is written ⇒ the LR is inside the draw-record fn. Then read its accessible D3D state (vertex streams,
  shader, textures, RT from the device object) and translate to vkCmdDraw. Alternative: a prod hardware
  watchpoint on the cmd-buffer for an op-0x36 write (flaky here, as the 0x827FD56C watchpoints were). The
  translator's Vulkan side (state-extraction reg-file, ported shaders, render-thread swapchain) is READY; the
  whole remaining renderer work is this draw EXTRACTION + the per-draw-type Vulkan translation. Multi-session.

### cont.12 (c7) — draw-record INTERCEPTION is a proven NO-GO (XDK D3D inlined); only the PM4 cmd-buffer extraction is viable
Pursued the targeted draw-record-fn search. The cmd-buffer base/writeptr writers (device+13568/+13572) trace
to sub_821CC830 — and that is D3D FRAME-BEGIN (resets device+13568/13572=0, allocs the ring segments via
sub_821C5BA8), NOT a draw. ⚠ This re-confirms the prior HLE-spike (same branch, 2 days ago, [[sp_hle_phase0_progress]])
DETERMINATION: the title's static XDK D3D **INLINES every draw/state emit as PM4 stores** — there is NO
per-draw / per-sprite / per-material guest FUNCTION to hook (RE-confirmed at call-structure level); the draws
are PM4 stores deep in the render subtrees (frame render sub_82150970 → 10 structural passes; kicks
sub_821C6600 ~11/frame, NOT draw-proportional). And "texture binding only via PM4" — a non-PM4 override never
gets the texture SET_CONSTANT, so it can't reconstruct sprites.
- ⇒ The user-picked "intercept the draw-record function" is TECHNICALLY BLOCKED (no such function exists —
  the D3D is inlined). This is exactly why the HLE variant-B native-render spike was a NO-GO.
- ⇒ The ONLY viable draw input for the renderer is the **PM4 cmd-buffer** (option A): crack the title's
  deferred cmd-buffer (device+13568) and execute its PM4 — which carries BOTH the DRAW_INDX_2 packets AND the
  SET_CONSTANT(0x4800 fetch+tex / 0x4000 ALU) state the existing CP already applies. cont.11's REX_CHUNKCP
  LINEAR parse desynced on the title's custom structure (PM4 interleaved with inline-vertex floats +
  0x8100xxxx segment-link descriptors); the fix is a STRUCTURED parse — follow the segment chain (the 0x38/
  0x79 ops / 0x8100xxxx links) and parse PM4 within each segment, skipping/handling the inline-vertex regions.
  This is cont.11's "full cmd-buffer enumeration (hard)" — now established as the ONLY path (interception is
  ruled out), scoped to the menu where the title builds real textured draws into device+13568 ~0x88680/frame.
- The CP/Vulkan side is ready (SET_CONSTANT→reg-file extraction, ported shaders, render-thread swapchain). The
  whole remaining renderer = this structured deferred-cmd-buffer parse → feed the real DRAW_INDX+state to the
  existing CP draw path → translate to vkCmdDraw. Multi-session, but now the approach is unambiguous.

## cont.12(c8) — Option A is MOOT: the title builds NO real draws; render-path INDIRECT-NULL is the real gate

**Ran the structured device+13568 chunk dump (REX_CHUNKDUMP) + a per-swap brute draw-scan over a full menu run.
The conclusion is decisive and overturns Option A's premise.**

- **device+13568 chunks hold only 1–3 draws each (max 16), and they are ALL degenerate rects.** Per-swap brute
  histogram over 14,460 swaps: 2943 chunks×1 draw, 2008×2, 1143×3, 165×4, 142×6, 164×7, 164×16 — never the
  dozens/hundreds a real menu needs. The structured dump of a draw-bearing chunk = a few init packets (op 0x02
  cnt10, T0 reg0x168/0x2D0 writes) then ZEROS to the end. The chunk is barely filled.
- **Three independent draw-scans converge:** route-B SEGCP = 120 [draw], ALL `init=0x30088 numInd=3 prim=8`,
  **0 textures bound**; ring/CP path = 60 [draw], ALL `init=0x30088` rect, **0 textures**; chunk brute-scan =
  rects only. variant A builds ONLY untextured degenerate rects, in BOTH intro AND menu. **There is nothing to
  extract** — Option A (crack device+13568) cannot produce textured draws that the title never builds.
- **Root cause = render-path INDIRECT-NULL on uninitialized objects.** The last non-spam lines before the ~33s
  segv are indirect calls whose targets are FLOATS read out of an object's vtable slot:
  `target=0x3E340000 (0.176f) @ lr=0x821BF834`, `target=0x43A04000 (320.0f) @ lr=0x821CC4B0`,
  `target=0x421A0000 (38.5f) @ lr=0x821B925C`, plus `target=0x82367BD8 @ lr=0x8236859C` (a real code addr —
  near-miss / unregistered). The caller sites **`sub_821BFF48` and `sub_821CC5D0` are in the prod oracle's
  recurring render-function set** (sub_82450FD0×30, sub_8230FA80/E898/E7D8×9, sub_82150970, sub_821CC5D0,
  sub_821BFF48, sub_821B9270…). So these ARE the draw path; in variant A their state objects are uninitialized
  (vtable field = float data) → the indirect dispatch fails → the title SKIPS the textured content draws
  (emitting only the clear/background rects) and then crashes ~33s. SAME class as the singleton-ctor bug fixed
  earlier this session (uninit object → null/garbage vtable → INDIRECT-NULL).
- **⇒ The renderer's real prerequisite is NOT cmd-buffer extraction but fixing the render-path uninitialized-
  object cluster** (`sub_821BFF48` / `sub_821CC5D0` / `sub_821B9270` / `sub_8236859C` callers) so the indirect
  calls dispatch, the title runs its content-draw code, and real textured DRAW_INDX_2 + SET_CONSTANT(0x4800)
  state finally appears in the cmd-buffer. THEN extraction has something to render. This is exactly the
  INDIRECT-NULL-vtable recovery via the prod oracle the user endorsed earlier — now localized to the render path.
- Diagnostics added (gated, default boot unregressed): `REX_CHUNKDUMP` = per-swap brute draw-scan of the active
  device+13568 chunk + one-time structured PM4 dump of the first draw-bearing chunk ([chunkscan]/[chunkdump]).

## cont.12(c9) — render-path INDIRECT-NULL cluster mapped: it's a NOTOKEN RACE, plus one recompiler gap fixed

Drilled into the render-path INDIRECT-NULL cluster (user picked "fix the render-path cluster"). REX_INDDUMP
(dumps GPRs + vtable chain per distinct site) over several NOTOKEN menu runs. The cluster is **heterogeneous**,
and crucially **the set varies run-to-run** — the smoking gun for a race.

- **Site structures (recomp source):**
  - `sub_821CC310` (owns lr=0x821CC4B0): a work-queue executor. `r31 = *(r3)` is a command/sync object —
    spinlock at +0 (lwarx/stwcx CAS loop), ready-mask at +56, count at +60, **callback fn-ptr at +16**. It
    fills fields (+0/+24/+28/+32/+36) then `bctrl *(r31+16)` with r3=r30. In variant A `*(r31+16)=0x43A04000`
    = **320.0f** (a screen coord, not a code pointer).
  - `sub_821B9270` (owns lr=0x821B925C): `bctrl r9` with a float arg (f1 = f13·f12·f0); r9 was loaded earlier
    and in variant A = `0x421A0000` = **38.5f**.
  - `sub_821BF834`: target `0x3E340000` = **0.176f**.
  - `sub_82249C58`/`sub_82448B70`: target = garbage with `r31=0xFFFFFFFF` and `*(r31+4)=0xC0012D01` (a real
    PM4 packet: type3 op0x2D SET_CONSTANT) — i.e. a command-buffer walk reading PM4 *data* as a fn-ptr.
- **It's a RACE, not a deterministic missing-init.** Run A: float-vtable sites + crash ~33s. Run B: jump-table
  + garbage sites. Run C (after the fix below): **only the benign 0x82292D08, segv=0, NO crash, ran the full
  32s.** Same binary, same env — the set and the crash are non-deterministic. The specific float values
  (320f/38.5f) are not random garbage: the render-command objects are **pooled/reused**, and under the
  preemptive NOTOKEN scheduler the executor (sub_821CC310) sometimes runs **before the enqueuer finishes
  constructing the object**, reading the previous occupant's **stale float data** at the +16 callback offset.
  Classic use-before-init on a recycled pool slot. This unifies the scheduler tension: the cooperative single
  token serializes (no race) but starves the VC-1 decoder; NOTOKEN feeds the decoder but races the render-
  command construction. ⇒ the renderer needs a scheduler that does **both** (Step-1, real synchronization).
- **One DETERMINISTIC site fixed (a genuine recompiler gap, not a race): `sub_82367BD8`.** `sub_82367B88` is a
  12-way switch: `r12 = 0x82360000+31656 = 0x82367BA8 (table base); bctr *(table + r3*4)`. XenonAnalyse
  mis-identified the table at 0x82367BA8 as CODE and decoded its 12 address-dwords as 12 `lwz r17,X(r22)`
  instructions (the bogus "sub_82367BA8"), absorbing case-0's handler — which sits right after the table at
  **0x82367BD8 = `li r3,0 ; blr`** — so it was never emitted as a callable function. Cases 1-11 (sub_82367BE0
  /BE8/BF0/BFC/C08/C14/C20/C2C/C38/C44) WERE emitted; only case-0 was lost. Re-supplied it in PPCInvokeGuest
  (small always-on switch, transcribed from the recomp's own decode): `case 0x82367BD8: ctx.r3.s64=0; return;`.
  Verified: the 0x82367BD8 INDIRECT-NULL (4 call sites in the sub_82368xxx float-format chain) is gone; default
  boot unregressed (VdSwap=6, segv=0, devOver=0). This is the reusable pattern for other recompiler jump-table
  gaps (in-range, decodable, consistent target).
- **Pivotal open question for next session:** does a verified RACE-FREE run actually build textured content
  draws (textures bound) into device+13568? If yes → the render gate is purely the race → fix enqueuer/executor
  synchronization (Step-1) and the structured device+13568 parse THEN has real content. If a clean run still
  builds only rects → the divergence is deeper than the race. Answering it needs the structured device+13568
  parse run on a confirmed-clean boot (the brute-scan can't see texture binds; CHUNKCP desyncs). So Option A
  (the parse) is not dead — it is **gated on first getting a clean run**, which reframes the whole renderer:
  step 1 = race-free scheduling, step 2 = parse device+13568 on a clean run to confirm/extract textured draws.

## cont.12(c10) — pivotal experiment DONE: device+13568 is a STATE directory (no draws); even a clean run builds NO textured content

Ran the pivotal experiment the user picked. Cracked the device+13568 format and followed it on confirmed-clean
menu boots. **Answer: NO — a race-free run does not build textured draws; the divergence is deeper than the race.**

- **device+13568 is NOT inline PM4 — it's the title's SEGMENT DIRECTORY.** Each chunk holds records + segment
  descriptors **{0x81LLLLLL, phys_addr}** (LLLLLL = segment length in dwords) plus 0xC1/0xC2-tagged pointers.
  Resolve a descriptor's segment to a guest address with **guest = 0xA0000000 | (addr & 0x1FFFFFFF)** — verified
  correct (the segments then parse cleanly as PM4). (Brute-scanning the directory for op-0x22 headers gives
  FALSE POSITIVES: the 0xC134xxxx record/pointer words decode as op 0x22 — that's why the earlier "1–16
  draws/chunk" counts were noise.) Menu-frame directories carry ~11–20 descriptors; init chunks ~3.
- **Every followed segment is render STATE / EVENT / CALLBACK — ZERO draws.** Over 3 confirmed-CLEAN menu boots
  (g_nonBenignInd==0, swap#4002/4019, 11–13 descriptors each) the per-segment tally is `realDraws=0 rectDraws=0
  texFetch=0` for EVERY segment, no exceptions. The segment-start signatures: `C0004600`=COND_WRITE(0x46),
  `C0006000/C0006100`=op0x60/0x61, `C0003B00…C0025800`=EVENT_WRITE(0x58), SET_CONSTANT blocks (8/4 per state
  segment, all non-texture — texFetch=0), repeating data records `00000A31 0X000000 00010A2F`, and CALLBACK
  records **`0001057C 821CC7A0 <ctx>`** — a code pointer into the render executor region (sub_821CC*, the same
  family as sub_821CC310). So the directory is the per-frame **state + work-queue**; the actual DRAW packets
  (the init=0x30088 degenerate rects) are emitted to the **main ring** by the executor, and there are **no
  textured draws anywhere** — clean or raced.
- **⇒ The NOTOKEN race is NOT the whole render gate.** Fixing it makes the run not crash, but the title STILL
  emits only degenerate rects + state — never the textured draws prod builds on the identical guest (54
  pipelines). So the renderer is blocked by a **deeper divergence in the draw-issuing path itself**, not by the
  race, not by the cmd-buffer parse (device+13568 parses fine — it just contains no draws), and not by coverage
  (the draws ARE found; they're simply all rects). This unifies the entire multi-session search: ring, staging
  (SEGCP), and now the device+13568 directory ALL show only init=0x30088 rects with 0 textures.
- **Next direction (deep): why does variant A's render code emit only rects?** The thread to pull is the
  executor callback **0x821CC7A0** (carried by the `0001057C 821CC7A0` segment records) and its family
  sub_821CC310 — trace what it emits per work-item and why the textured-content draws prod issues are absent
  (a degraded render-object state that takes a degenerate path, or a content-draw subsystem that never runs).
  The race fix and the device+13568 parser remain useful downstream but are no longer the leading blocker.
- Diagnostics (gated, default boot unregressed VdSwap=6/segv=0): REX_CHUNKDUMP now = per-swap segment-descriptor
  count + CLEAN/RACED (g_nonBenignInd) + a one-time segment-FOLLOW of the first settled menu directory (resolves
  each {0x81LLLLLL,addr}, parses the segment, tallies realDraws/rectDraws/setConst/texFetch). g_nonBenignInd =
  count of non-benign (lr!=0x82292D08) INDIRECT-NULLs = the race indicator.

## cont.12(c11) — the unifying conclusion: the title BUILDS a deferred render program it never EXECUTES

User picked the executor-level trace ("why does draw-issuing emit only rects?"). Traced the executor callback
**0x821CC7A0** that the device+13568 segments carry (records `0001057C 821CC7A0 <ctx>`).

- **0x821CC7A0 = sub_821CC7A0 is a work-queue PRODUCER**, not a draw function: it stores its arg into a
  per-process ring buffer (base = *(0x8200098C/0x82000990) + procType·108 + 11328; count at +11412) and
  KeSetEvent's the consumer (sub_821CC310, which dequeues and calls *(item+16) to actually issue the draws).
- **Hooked it (REX_ENQLOG): over a full menu run sub_821CC7A0 is called ZERO times**, even though the menu is
  reached (36 shader loads) and the segments reference 0x821CC7A0 as a callback. So the segment render
  callbacks are **queued but never invoked** — the title's deferred render PROGRAM (the device+13568 segments:
  state + draw callbacks) is BUILT but never successfully EXECUTED. Meanwhile the fence-forward stopgap keeps
  satisfying the deferred-segment waits ([fencefwd] fence climbing 93717→93729…), so the title PROCEEDS as if
  the GPU ran the program — without the program actually running. The render-path INDIRECT-NULLs (e.g.
  `lr=0x821BF834 target=0xFFFFFFFF`, the same family the memory calls "WAIT_REG_MEM callbacks to 0x821BF860/
  0x821CC7A0") are plausibly the FAILED callback invocations of that program.
- **⇒ This UNIFIES the whole multi-session renderer search.** Every layer agreed the title emits only
  init=0x30088 rects with 0 textures (ring, staging/SEGCP, device+13568). The reason: variant A builds the
  textured render program (prod runs the same guest → 54 pipelines) but **never executes it** — only the
  directly-kicked degenerate rects reach the CP. Not a parse problem (device+13568 parses), not a coverage
  problem (the draws are found — they're rects), not purely the NOTOKEN race (clean runs also lack textured
  draws), not the draw-issuing logic per se — it's that the **deferred render program is never run**, exactly
  the stopgap hazard cont.11 flagged ("fence-forward lets the title proceed; deferred draws skipped").
- **Two concrete renderer paths (multi-session, pick next session):** (A) make the title execute its own
  program — drive the real GPU↔CPU handshake / fix the render-path callback invocations (the INDIRECT-NULL
  race + whatever gates sub_821CC7A0/the consumer) so the segments run; or (B) execute the device+13568
  segments OURSELVES — the directory format is cracked ({0x81LLLLLL,addr}, resolve 0xA0000000|(addr&0x1FFFFFFF)),
  so a real CP can walk it, run each segment's PM4, and invoke its callbacks (0x821CC7A0 → producer → consumer
  → draws), replacing the fence-forward so the fence advances as a REAL result. (B) is the "full cmd-buffer
  enumeration" route, now unblocked by the cracked format; (A) needs the deferred-execution trigger RE'd.
- Caveat to resolve first next session: confirm whether the segment callbacks are *attempted-and-fail*
  (INDIRECT-NULL at 0x821BF834/0x821BF860) vs *never reached* — hook 0x821BF860 + the consumer sub_821CC310 to
  see if the segment-execution path runs at all. That disambiguates path (A) (fix the failing invocation) from
  needing path (B) (drive it ourselves). Diagnostic added: REX_ENQLOG ([enq], gated; default boot unregressed).

## cont.12(c12) — disambiguation: leans path A — the render path is REACHED but its callback queues are EMPTY

Hooked the consumer sub_821CC310 too (REX_ENQLOG). Over a full menu run:

- **The sub_821CC* work-queue is DORMANT: producer sub_821CC7A0 = 0 calls AND consumer sub_821CC310 = 0 calls.**
  So the 0x821CC7A0 callbacks the device+13568 segments carry are **dead data** for the menu — that queue is
  not the active render path. (So path B "execute the segments + invoke 0x821CC7A0" is weakly supported — it'd
  drive a queue the title itself never uses.)
- **The ACTIVE render attempt is `sub_821BF748`** (the function that owns the INDIRECT-NULL at 0x821BF834). It's
  a **spinlock-protected DPC / callback-queue processor**: `KfAcquireSpinLock(r3+16920)`, increments a counter
  at +16756, stamps `mftb` at +16760, compares head/tail at +16908/+16912, and calls the queued callback at
  **`*(r31+16752)`** under a null-check. variant A: that callback is **null on a clean run (null-check skips it
  → no draw) or garbage 0xFFFFFFFF when raced (→ INDIRECT-NULL)**. Either way the **render-callback queue is
  EMPTY** — nothing valid was ever enqueued into it.
- **⇒ Path A, but the real gap is UPSTREAM of the callback site:** the render path IS reached (sub_821BF748
  runs every frame), it's just that **no producer enqueues textured render work** into its queue (+16752 stays
  null/garbage). This is the same shape as the dormant sub_821CC7A0 producer. So the divergence is the **menu
  render logic never enqueuing the textured-content render callbacks** — consistent with "emits only rects."
  Fixing the INDIRECT-NULL race (making +16752 not *garbage*) would only turn a crash into a *null-skip*, still
  no draw — so the race genuinely is NOT the gate (reconfirms c10/c11). The gate is **why nothing is enqueued**.
- **Next session (deep, the actual root): find the render-work PRODUCER** — what code in prod enqueues a valid
  callback into sub_821BF748's queue (+16752) / sets up the textured-draw render items, and why variant A's
  menu never calls it. Prod-oracle: break in prod at sub_821BF748, read the live `*(r31+16752)` (the real
  callback fn) + walk back to its enqueuer; then check whether that enqueuer runs in variant A. That enqueuer
  (or the object/state it needs) is the missing piece. Diagnostic: REX_ENQLOG now also hooks sub_821CC310
  ([consumer]); default boot unregressed.

## cont.13 (2026-06-03/04, autonomous) — RENDER PATH REFRAMED via prod oracle: the producer is the source=1 gfx-interrupt DPC; sub_821BF748/+16752 (c12's lead) is a DEAD END

Prod oracle (gdb on `out/build/linux-amd64-release/south_park_td`, base=0x100000000, `handle SIGSEGV nostop pass`) overturns c12 and pins the real render dispatch + a concrete success metric.

**c12's lead (sub_821BF748 +16752) is a DEAD END — proven in prod.** Object guest 0x40016f80, callback slot guest 0x4001b0f0 (+0x4170). A HARDWARE watchpoint on the slot over 160s at full vblank rate NEVER fired, and the dispatch `call *%rax` (sub_821BF748+387) executed **0 times**. So prod's +16752 callback is null too — sub_821BF748 is the **vblank (source=0)** DPC processor, NOT the render path. The +16752 chase was a red herring.

**The REAL render producer path (verified, prod):** producer `sub_821CC7A0` is called **4192×/120s** (consumer `sub_821CC310` 4191×, `sub_821BF860` 2095×). Backtrace:
`CommandProcessor::WorkerThreadMain -> ExecutePrimaryBuffer -> ExecuteIndirectBuffer -> ExecutePacketType3_INTERRUPT -> DispatchInterruptCallback -> ExecuteInterrupt -> sub_821C7170 -> sub_821CC7A0`.
⇒ the title's per-frame command stream (IBs in the PRIMARY ring) carries **INTERRUPT (type-3 op 0x54) packets**; the CP fires the guest gfx-interrupt **source=1 (command-complete)** → handler `sub_821C7170` → producer → enqueues render work → consumer `sub_821CC310` dequeues + calls *(item+16) → draws.

**sub_821C7170 decoded (prod disasm).** Two paths on the source arg:
- source==0 (vblank): reads MMIO 0x7FC86544 bit0, calls sub_821BF748 (the dead +16752 queue).
- source==1 (cmd-complete): `callback = *( *(g_interruptData + 0x2A94) + 0x10 )`, null-checked at +122 (skips the call if null), resolved + called at +204 (guest LR **0x821C71A4** = variant A's long-standing INDIRECT-NULL site). In prod this callback = sub_821CC7A0 (or sub_821BF860).
**0x2A94 = 10900** — EXACTLY the field variant A's `FireGfxInterrupt` STOPGAP checks (`if(source==1 && *(g_interruptData+10900)==0xFFFFFFFF) return;`). So `B = *(device+0x2A94)` = the per-submission completion object; `*(B+0x10)` = the DPC callback to run. Prod values: device(=g_interruptData=r4)=0x40016f80, B=0xffc9a000, *(B+0x10)=0x821cc7a0.

**variant A state (REX_INTLOG+REX_ENQLOG added this session; NOTOKEN+CSLEAK menu run, reaches SPTextured/SPBackdropTextured shader loads):**
- producer sub_821CC7A0 = **0**, consumer = 0, PM4_INTERRUPT executed = **1** (vs prod's per-frame stream).
- source=1 FireGfxInterrupt fired **3×**, all identical: `iData=0x00026F80 B=*(+10900)=0xA2011000 *(B+0x10)=0x00000000 -> FIRE`.
  ⇒ B is VALID (not the 0xFFFFFFFF sentinel) so the STOPGAP is NOT the blocker; **`*(B+0x10)` is NULL** — the producer was never registered into the completion object, so sub_821C7170's null-check skips the call.
⇒ Two divergences, one root: (D1) `*(B+0x10)` null (producer not registered) and (D2) source=1 barely fires (1 INTERRUPT packet vs prod's per-frame stream). Both because **variant A's CP never executes the title's per-frame render command stream** — the IBs with the INTERRUPT packets + the device+13568 segment records `0001057C 821CC7A0 <ctx>` that register the producer. This is the long-known "ring frozen WPTR=37 / flush sub_821C6D58 gated / deferred program never executed" root, now pinned to a concrete dispatch mechanism + success metric.

**SUCCESS METRIC for the renderer:** `REX_ENQLOG [enq]` (sub_821CC7A0) > 0 ⇒ producer fires ⇒ consumer issues real draws.

**NEXT:** (a) find who writes `*(B+0x10)=0x821CC7A0` in prod (the completion-callback registration; a prod HW watchpoint on B+0x10 armed at the first source=1 interrupt did NOT fire in 90s ⇒ it's written earlier, during graphics init — arm earlier / trace sub_821C73D8 which sets device+0x2A94=B, or follow the device+13568 `821CC7A0 <ctx>` segment records); (b) decide fix: drive variant A's CP to execute the per-frame IBs/segments so the INTERRUPT packets fire + B+0x10 gets registered (route B, now with the dispatch mechanism understood), vs. the title's own flush sub_821C6D58. Diagnostic added: **REX_INTLOG** ([int], default boot unregressed).

## cont.14 (2026-06-04, autonomous) — RENDER DEADLOCK ROOT FOUND: kick gated by a pending-counter (device+0x2b04) the CONSUMER (sub_821CC310, tid=10) must decrement — it never runs. Unifies with tid=10 starvation.

Continuing cont.13 (real render path = source=1 gfx-interrupt → producer sub_821CC7A0). Traced WHY variant A never executes the per-frame command stream, to the root.

**Per-frame render-submit chain RUNS in variant A but the KICK is gated.** Prod kicks the ring (sub_821C6600) 7062×/45s; variant A only 6× (init). Chain: `sub_82249638→…→sub_821CC830(D3D frame)→sub_821C6D58(flush)→sub_821C6C80→sub_821C6600(kick)`. variant A reaches the flush (3322×) and sub_821C6C80 (1410×) per-frame, but kicks 6×.

**The gate (decoded from prod disasm + verified both sides): `sub_821C6C80` kicks only when `*(device+0x2b04)==0`** (0x2b04=11012). Non-zero → runs a "process-pending" block (sub_821C5CD0) and DEFERS the kick.
- prod: the field oscillates **0↔1** (mostly 0 → kicks).
- variant A (REX_KICKGATE): the field climbs **MONOTONICALLY 0→1→2→…→0xA…→ and NEVER resets** → stuck non-zero → kick deferred forever after the 6 init kicks.

**device+0x2b04 is a pending-segment counter (producer/consumer flow control), proven by a prod HW watchpoint on device+0x2b04 (0x140019a84):**
- **Increment (→N+1):** render thread `sub_82249638→sub_82249678→sub_82249970→sub_82249AD0→sub_82150970→sub_821BF298→sub_821CCA28→sub_821C6C80` (queues a pending segment, defers the kick).
- **Decrement (→0):** `sub_82450FD0(thread)→sub_821CC5D0→sub_821CC310(CONSUMER)→sub_821CC140` — the consumer, when it drains a work item, decrements the counter.

**⇒ THE DEADLOCK / RENDER ROOT:** the consumer **sub_821CC310** runs on **tid=10 (thread entry sub_82450FD0)** — the long-starved/blocked thread (cont.8–12). In variant A the consumer NEVER runs (`[consumer]=0`), so device+0x2b04 is never decremented → climbs forever → the kick is permanently deferred → no per-frame IBs reach the ring → no INTERRUPT packets → the producer never fires → no draws. **The renderer root IS the tid=10/consumer-not-running problem.** (Parallel break from cont.13: even on the source=1 fires that do happen, `*(B+0x10)` is null — the producer isn't registered as the completion callback; that registration likely also lives on the consumer/tid-10 path.)

This UNIFIES the whole renderer search with the tid=10 starvation thread: rendering is a cross-thread producer/consumer pipeline (GPU-CP-interrupt producer ⟷ tid-10 consumer sub_821CC310) gated by the pending counter device+0x2b04; variant A's consumer side (tid=10) is dead, so the pipeline never flows and the ring goes idle after init.

**NEXT:** find why variant A's tid=10 (sub_82450FD0) never reaches the consumer loop sub_821CC5D0→sub_821CC310 (under NOTOKEN+CSLEAK): does the thread run at all? does it diverge into sub_82250420/sub_8211B740 instead? is it blocked on an object the (dead) producer should signal? Making the consumer run (decrement device+0x2b04 + issue draws via *(item+16)) is the renderer unblock. Diagnostic added: REX_KICKGATE ([kickgate]).

## cont.15 (2026-06-04, autonomous) — BOOTSTRAP experiment VALIDATES the producer/consumer model; PROVES textured draws are producer/consumer work items, not kicked segments

Tested the cont.14 model with gated, default-safe interventions (REX_BOOTSTRAP):

1. **Register the producer into *(B+0x10) when source=1 fires.** Result: the producer **sub_821CC7A0 FIRED ([enq]=1, was 0)** and the consumer **sub_821CC310 RAN ([consumer]=1, was 0)** — the producer→consumer chain mechanically works. BUT the work item was EMPTY: `[enq] item=0x0`, `[consumer] r3=0x29C98 item=*(r3)=0x29A44 handler=*(item+16)=0x0` (null draw handler) → no draw. variant A's work items (a device-relative ring near device+0x2AC4) exist but their handlers are null — the per-frame render submission that populates them didn't complete.

2. **Also force the kick gate open** (device+0x2b04=0 in sub_821C6C80). Result: kicks **FLOW — sub_821C6600 fired 2725× (was 6)**, the ring is alive, the CP executes the per-frame segments. BUT the draws are STILL **only init=0x30088 prim=8 numInd=3 untextured RECTS** (149/150 logged, 0 textured), then crashes (INDIRECT-NULL 0x80000000 @ lr=0x82448B70 — forcing kicks skips the title's segment bookkeeping → corruption). Force-kick hack reverted (left an inline NOTE; PROVEN non-viable).

**DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS:**
- The producer/consumer pipeline (sub_821CC7A0 → sub_821CC310) is the correct render mechanism and works when driven (validated end to end).
- **The textured draws are NOT in the directly-kicked command segments** — kicking them 2725× yields only rects. Textured content is produced by the producer/consumer pipeline processing REAL work items (handler = the draw fn at *(item+16), called via lr=0x821CC4B0).
- The real work items / completion objects (B) / item handlers are populated by the title's full render submission running against a FAITHFUL GPU (real command completion + interrupt timing). variant A's fence-forward stub fakes the fence value but not the completion semantics, so the submission produces incomplete state (null handlers, unpopulated B) and the pending counter device+0x2b04 is never decremented. Simple hacks turn the cranks with no grain (null items) or flow only the rect segments.

⇒ The renderer genuinely requires a **faithful CP / GPU-completion model**, not a stopgap. All pieces are now mapped: (real render path = source=1 interrupt → producer; gate = pending counter device+0x2b04; cross-thread producer(GPU-CP-interrupt)/consumer(tid-10 sub_821CC310); draw = item handler *(item+16)).

**NEXT (the real renderer, multi-session):** when variant A's CP consumes a kicked segment, MODEL its completion: (a) decrement device+0x2b04 (mimic the consumer) so kicks flow naturally; (b) fire the source=1 interrupt with the completion object B set up for that segment so the producer enqueues the segment's REAL work item (with a non-null handler); (c) let the consumer (tid-10, runs under NOTOKEN) drain it → issue the textured draw via *(item+16). Open RE: how a kicked segment maps to its completion object B + work-item handler (so the CP can populate them on completion). Diagnostics retained (gated, default boot unregressed): REX_INTLOG, REX_KICKGATE, REX_ENQLOG, REX_BOOTSTRAP (experiment).

## cont.16 (2026-06-04, autonomous) — completion object B characterized (prod vs variant A): variant A's B is ZERO-filled (unpopulated)

gdb dump of the per-submission completion object B = *(device+0x2A94), the descriptor the source=1 interrupt's producer is driven from:
- **prod (B=0xffc9a000):** B[0]=**4**, B+0x10=**0x821CC7A0** (producer callback), B+0x14=**0xddd10180** (per-submission context = the render work the producer enqueues), rest 0. (device+0x2b04 counter read =1 concurrently.)
- **variant A (B=0xA2011000), REX_INTLOG:** `B[0]=0 *(B+0x10)=0 *(B+0x14)=0` — **ENTIRELY ZERO**. B is allocated (device+10900 points to it) but NEVER populated.

⇒ variant A's completion object is a bare zero allocation; the title's render submission never writes {count, producer callback, render context} into it, because variant A's fence-forward stub GPU doesn't drive the faithful command-completion that triggers the population. This is exactly why cont.15's force-B+0x10 gave an empty work item — B+0x14 (the context) is also null. **The faithful-completion fix must populate B[0]/B+0x10/B+0x14 per completed segment** (callback=producer sub_821CC7A0, context=the segment's render work; format TBD — 0xddd10180 is an unusual handle / write-combined address, not a plain guest pointer). This is the precise remaining RE for the renderer. REX_INTLOG extended to dump B[0]/B+0x10/B+0x14.

## cont.17 (2026-06-04, autonomous) — route-B DIRECT-INVOKE: producer fires with real ctx (6886×) but the consumer doesn't drain (process-context/event obstacle)

REX_FINDCB located the deferred render program's producer-callback records {0001057C, 0x821CC7A0, ctx} (c11) — staging range = 2/frame, device+13568 chunk = 4 — with REAL per-record contexts **ctx=0xC0090180 / 0xC0117B00** (GPU-physical 0xC-window, analogous to prod's B+0x14=0xddd10180). So the records carry valid contexts; variant A queues but never invokes them.

REX_INVOKECB (route-B direct-invoke): call `sub_821CC7A0(ctx)` for each staging record (bypassing the unpopulated/aliased completion object B). Result:
- **The producer FIRED 6886× (22 distinct item-types) — up from 0.** Invoking the records with their real ctx DOES drive the producer to enqueue.
- **BUT the consumer sub_821CC310 STILL didn't run ([consumer]=0)** — the producer's KeSetEvent didn't wake it. Likely a **process-context mismatch**: the producer enqueues into the per-process ring (base=*(0x8200098C)+procType·108+11328) for the CURRENT thread's procType (VdSwap's), while the consumer (tid=10) drains a DIFFERENT procType's ring — so the work + the event signal miss the consumer.
- Crashes on the render-path INDIRECT-NULL 0xFFFFFFFF @ lr=0x821BF834.

⇒ The producer can be driven directly with the records' real ctx, but the producer→consumer handoff fails on a process-context/event mismatch (+ a render-path null). **Next obstacle:** invoke the producer on the procType the consumer (tid=10) drains — read the *(0x8200098C)+procType·108 ring layout, match contexts — OR signal the consumer's wait directly. Diagnostics REX_FINDCB / REX_INVOKECB added (gated, default boot unregressed; INVOKECB crashes when used — a scaffold for the next session).

## cont.18 (2026-06-04, autonomous) — FIX PROGRESS: pump-context completion (REX_PUMPCB) WAKES the consumer (no crash); drain not yet sustained + no draws

Building on cont.17 (route-B direct-invoke fired the producer 6886× from VdSwap's context but the consumer never drained + crashed at INDIRECT-NULL). REX_PUMPCB drives the same producer/consumer from the **PUMP context** (its procType matches the consumer's — cont.15 showed a pump-fired interrupt wakes the consumer): each vblank, scan the device+13568 chunk for callback records {0001057C,821CC7A0,ctx}, populate B{+0x10=0x821CC7A0,+0x14=ctx}, fire source=1.

Result (NOTOKEN+CSLEAK menu run): [pumpcb] fired 764, **producer [enq]=17** (was 0), **consumer [consumer]=1** (was 0), **NO CRASH** (vs INVOKECB's crash — ran the full 40s). ⇒ firing on the pump context DID wake the consumer — confirms the cont.17 procType hypothesis (VdSwap's context was wrong, the pump's is right). BUT:
- The consumer drained only **1×** (not sustained) despite 764 fires / 17 producer enqueues — the producer's repeated KeSetEvents don't re-wake it (event auto-reset semantics, the consumer doesn't re-loop, or tid=10 stalls after the first drain).
- No textured draws (only the 1 init=0x30088 rect). (The [consumer] hook logs the queue-head sentinel handler=0, so it's unclear if the real dequeued item had a handler — but no draw was issued regardless.)

⇒ Genuine incremental fix progress: the producer/consumer render pipeline now PARTIALLY flows from the pump context (producer fires, consumer wakes once, stable). **Remaining obstacles:** (a) sustain the consumer drain — RE the consumer's KeWait/event re-arming and why it drains 1 of N (read sub_821CC5D0's wait object + sub_821CC310's dequeue loop); (b) get a real draw — verify the ctx's render data / work-item handler is complete (it may itself depend on more of the title's submission running). Diagnostics REX_PUMPCB / REX_FINDCB / REX_INVOKECB (gated, default boot unregressed).

### cont.18 refinement — the consumer-sustain blocker is event RE-WAKE, not a tid=10 stall
Under REX_PUMPCB, gdb counts: consumer dispatch sub_821CC5D0 entered **2×** (identical to the baseline cont.14 — so tid=10 is NOT stalling/diverging) and sub_821CC310 drained **1×**. ⇒ the consumer thread sits inside sub_821CC5D0's internal `KeWaitForSingleObject` loop; the FIRST producer KeSetEvent wakes it (drains 1) but the subsequent ones (17 enqueues / 764 fires) do NOT re-wake it. This is a variant A KERNEL event/wait re-signal issue (its own C++: KeSetEvent → KeWaitForSingleObject across threads under NOTOKEN), NOT deep guest RE — a tractable next target. NEXT: read variant A's KeSetEvent + KeWaitForSingleObject + the specific event object the consumer waits on; verify auto-reset re-signal semantics wake a re-blocked waiter. Once the consumer drains sustainedly, re-check whether real (textured) draws issue (work-item handler completeness).

### cont.18 refinement 2 — the event wait/signal is CORRECT; the consumer-drain-1 is the producer/consumer RING semantics
Read variant A's WaitObject/SignalObject (NOTOKEN path): SignalObject sets obj+0x04=state under g_waitMutex + g_waitCv.notify_all(); WaitObject waits on g_waitCv with predicate `GLD32(obj+4)>0`, consumes (auto-reset decrement) on wake. This is CORRECT (no lost-wakeup — the predicate catches a signal that races the re-wait). So the event re-wake is NOT the blocker. gdb showed sub_821CC5D0 woke **2×** but drained (sub_821CC310) only **1×** — the 2nd wake found the per-process ring "empty" despite 17 producer enqueues. ⇒ the blocker is the **producer/consumer ring accounting**: the producer's enqueue (per-process ring base=*(0x8200098C)+procType·108+11328, count+11412) isn't accumulating into the ring the consumer drains, OR the consumer's dequeue count is off. Likely contributors: (1) my REX_PUMPCB re-scans the SAME device+13568 records every vblank (no cursor) → re-fires the same ctx → the producer may dedup/overwrite one ring slot; (2) a procType mismatch between the pump-context producer and the consumer's ring. NEXT: add a cursor to PUMPCB (process each record once); instrument the producer's ring count (+11412) vs the consumer's dequeue; confirm the pump's procType == the consumer's (KeGetCurrentProcessType). THEN re-check real (textured) draws. This is the precise, bounded remaining work to make the producer/consumer render pipeline flow sustainedly.

## cont.19 (2026-06-04, autonomous) — the producer/consumer pipeline CAN be driven, but the work data is INCOMPLETE; a faithful CP/GPU model is the fundamental requirement

Spacing the pump fires to 1 record/vblank (vs 16) to avoid auto-reset-event collapse: [consumer] STILL =1 over 834 spaced fires — and KeGetCurrentProcessType always returns 1, so procType matches (not the issue). Re-reading the result: the consumer's drain sub_821CC310 is called ONCE and drains the whole available BATCH in that call (its internal loop), so [consumer]=1 means "drained the batch" (14 producer items); the producer then stops enqueuing (the device records are static → same ctx → dedup → no new items → no re-signal), so the consumer correctly waits. **So the producer/consumer render pipeline DID RUN — 14 items enqueued + drained — but produced NO textured draws (60 init=0x30088 rects only) and crashed (INDIRECT-NULL).**

⇒ **DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION:** the producer/consumer pipeline can be DRIVEN (producer fires with real ctx, consumer drains the batch), but the WORK ITEMS' render data is INCOMPLETE in variant A — the ctx (0xC0090180) → work item → handler `*(item+16)` doesn't issue a valid textured draw (null → crash). The render work is incomplete because the title's render submission is built against variant A's **STUB GPU** (fence-forward, no real command execution / completion), so the draw state, work-item handlers, and completion objects the producer/consumer rely on are never fully populated. **The menu renderer fundamentally requires a FAITHFUL CP / GPU-completion model** so the title's render submission COMPLETES and builds real, complete render work — driving the producer/consumer shells alone is necessary but NOT sufficient.

**The complete render pipeline + every gating mechanism is now mapped (cont.13–19):** source=1 gfx-interrupt → sub_821C7170 → producer sub_821CC7A0 (callback at *(*(device+0x2A94)+0x10)) → consumer sub_821CC310 (tid=10) → draw `*(item+16)`; gated by the pending-counter device+0x2b04 (consumer decrements) and the per-process work-item ring; work items carry real contexts (0xC0090180) from device+13568 records {0001057C,821CC7A0,ctx}. The remaining work is the multi-session core renderer: a faithful CP that EXECUTES the title's command stream + models GPU completion, so the render work is built completely. Gated scaffolds retained: REX_PUMPCB / REX_INVOKECB / REX_FINDCB / REX_INTLOG / REX_KICKGATE / REX_BOOTSTRAP. Default boot unregressed throughout.

### cont.20 — synthesis confirms the work-data-incomplete conclusion across all drive approaches
Combined INVOKECB (producer arg = the record's real ctx) with PUMPCB's pump context: call sub_821CC7A0 directly with r3=ctx on g_pumpKpcr (procType matches the consumer). Result: producer [enq]=17, consumer drains the batch, but STILL no textured draws (1 rect) + crash. ⇒ Confirms cont.19 across ALL THREE drive variants (INVOKECB / PUMPCB-via-interrupt / PUMPCB-direct-ctx): the producer/consumer pipeline RUNS when driven, but the work item's render data — `*(item+16)` handler + draw state — is incomplete because the title built its submission against variant A's STUB GPU. No amount of driving the producer/consumer shells substitutes for real GPU command execution. ⇒ the faithful CP/GPU model (varianta/RENDERER-DESIGN.md) is the required, multi-session core renderer work. Single-session RE + drive-experiments are exhausted at this fundamental wall.

## cont.21 (2026-06-04, autonomous) — ⭐ PROD-ORACLE RE-GROUNDING: cont.19/20 premise FALSIFIED; producer/consumer is COMPLETION BOOKKEEPING, not the draw path; the renderer needs a real PM4→Vulkan CP

Used the **prod oracle** (rexglue `south_park_td`, full symbols, recomp ABI rdi=&ctx rsi=base, PPCContext.r3 at offset 0 — verified by disasm of `__imp__sub_821CC7A0`) to measure the ground truth the cont.13–20 RE was inferring. Five decisive measurements (tools committed under `varianta/tools/prod_*.gdb`):

1. **Producer work item, PROD (`prod_producer.gdb`, break sub_821CC7A0, read r3 + `*(item+16)`):** 12 fires, items `0xddd10180, 0xddd98a80, 0xdde21300…` (the per-submission ctx, +~0x88900 apart), layout `{+0=self+0x124 (vtable), +4=0x80000000, +8=0, +12=4, +16=0, +20=0}`. **`*(item+16)=0x00000000 in PROD TOO.** ⇒ cont.19/20's central premise ("variant A's work data is INCOMPLETE because `*(item+16)` is null") is **FALSIFIED** — a null handler at +16 is NORMAL. The work item is a small completion-notification object, not a draw command.
2. **Producer firing rate + backtrace:** prod producer fires ~4192×/120s ≈ **1/frame**, from `ExecutePacketType3_INTERRUPT → DispatchInterruptCallback → ExecuteInterrupt → sub_821C7170 → sub_821CC7A0`. 1/frame ≠ per-draw (~800/frame). ⇒ **the producer/consumer (sub_821CC7A0/sub_821CC310) is PER-SUBMISSION GPU-COMPLETION BOOKKEEPING, NOT the per-draw path.** The entire cont.13–20 chase treated it as the draw emitter — it is not.
3. **Where the draws actually are (`prod_cpmap.gdb`, break ExecutePrimaryBuffer/ExecuteIndirectBuffer/_DRAW_INDX/_INTERRUPT):** prod's host CP runs a tiny **primary ring** (start/end 0→25→31→37→42→86 …) that chains **indirect buffers** in the physical window (`0x1dc90040, 0x1dc90000, 0x1fc97000, …`). The DRAWS live in IBs — esp. a recurring **3592-dword IB at phys 0x1dc90540** (= variant A guest `0xBDC90540`), executed 3× per frame, carrying the frame's `DRAW_INDX` packets. ⇒ **draws are PM4 `DRAW_INDX` in kicked IBs, executed by the HOST command processor → Vulkan.** (Resolves the cont.10 "0 draws in device+13568 segments" paradox: the draws aren't in the title's segment-directory bookkeeping; they're in the IBs the title kicks to the primary ring — which variant A never reaches because it only kicks 6×.)
4. **Variant A's Vulkan side is PRESENT-ONLY (code read of runtime/vulkan_render.cpp + rex_render.h):** its own header says *"No PM4 translation yet."* There is **no `VkPipeline`, no pipeline cache, no `vkCmdDraw`** — only clear-present + the intro-movie YUV→RGB `vkCmdCopyBufferToImage` blit. ⇒ the prior "Vulkan side is READY, just no entry" claim is **overstated**; a real PM4→Vulkan **draw translator does not exist** and must be built.
5. **The variant-A stall is the kick-gate DEADLOCK, reconfirmed with the corrected lens:**
   - gdb all-thread bt of a stalled variant A: **main thread** is in the intro **movie widget sub_82425BF8 → sub_821BE680 → … → sub_821C0A70 → sub_821C6E58 (GPU fence-wait) → sub_821B9270 (spin)**; the **consumer** (sub_821CC5D0) blocks in `KeWaitForSingleObject`. So with NOTOKEN+CSLEAK alone the title hangs in the **intro movie** on a GPU completion fence.
   - With `REX_MOVIE_EOF=120 REX_XFLAG=1` (forced intro→menu), the title runs a **stable loop**: the fence-forward stopgap fakes completion every frame (`fence 607017→607065, head always +8`) — no crash, but it **suppresses draw submission** (the title never has to kick because completion is faked).
   - `REX_KICKGATE` in the menu loop: **6 KICK (counter=0, init) then 74 DEFER** — `device+0x2b04` climbs `0→9→0xA` monotonically and is **never decremented**. The title is *actively trying to submit frames* (74 deferred kicks) but the gate blocks every one because the pending-counter never returns to 0.
   - `REX_PUMPCB`/`REX_BOOTSTRAP` (drive the producer/consumer): producer fires (enq=17–20), consumer drains once, but **kicks stay at 6, WPTR frozen at 37** — driving the bookkeeping does NOT decrement the counter sustainedly and does NOT progress the title. Variant A B at source=1: `B[0]=0` (prod=4), `B+0x14=0` (prod = the real ctx) — the completion object is **unpopulated** because no real GPU execution drives the completion handshake.

**⭐ CORRECTED UNIFIED MODEL.** Variant A has no real GPU. Every point where the title submits GPU work and waits for its completion (intro-movie compositing via sub_821C6E58; per-frame menu submission via the kick gate) stalls on a completion that only real command execution produces — the fence advance, the pending-counter `device+0x2b04` decrement, and the completion-object B population (`B[0]`, `B+0x10`=producer, `B+0x14`=ctx). The fence-forward stopgap papers over this for *some* waits (target<head) which lets the title limp through init + intro + menu *logic*, but it **suppresses real draw submission** (the title stops kicking the draw IBs because completion is faked). The producer/consumer is **bookkeeping inside the completion handshake** (1/frame), not the draw emitter; `*(item+16)=0` is normal. The actual menu draws are PM4 `DRAW_INDX` in IBs (e.g. `0xBDC90540`) that the title only kicks once its completion handshake oscillates — which it can't, without real execution.

**⇒ RENDERER-DESIGN.md's prescription ("faithful CP — stop faking completion, execute the commands") STANDS, but its RATIONALE is corrected:** the goal is NOT to "build non-null `*(item+16)` work items" (those are null in prod too) — it is to make the title's **completion handshake oscillate** (counter decrement + fence advance as REAL results of executing each kicked submission) so the title **keeps kicking its draw IBs**, AND to **translate the kicked `DRAW_INDX` packets to Vulkan**. This is, in scope, the project's previously-identified structural-floor **GPU command processor** (PM4→Vulkan: vertex-fetch + the 19 .updb shaders→SPIR-V + textures + RT/blend/viewport + pipeline cache). The producer/consumer drive-experiments (cont.13–20) are a closed dead-end branch — necessary to map, but the producer/consumer is not where draws come from.

**NEXT (the two real pillars, in dependency order):**
- **(A) Flow the ring** — break the kick-gate deadlock by decrementing `device+0x2b04` as a real result of the CP completing each kicked submission (faithful per-completion decrement, NOT cont.15's blanket force-to-0). Success metric = **kicks climb past 6 / WPTR past 37** (title submits real frames → kicks the draw IBs). cont.15 proved forcing the counter flows the ring (2725 kicks) — a faithful decrement should too, without the forced-state crash.
- **(B) DRAW_INDX→Vulkan translator** — the actual renderer: per draw, build a VkPipeline from the reg-file state (0x4000 ALU consts, 0x4800 fetch consts → vertex streams + textures, RT/viewport/blend) + the bound .updb shader→SPIR-V, then vkCmdDraw into the swapchain (render thread owns it). Start by rendering whatever reaches the CP once (A) flows the ring.

New tools (committed, gated, default boot unregressed): `varianta/tools/prod_producer.gdb`, `prod_cpmap.gdb` (prod-oracle CP tracing — reusable).

### cont.21 pillar-A experiment — REX_CPCOMPLETE: counter-drain BREAKS the first gate (kicks 6→14) but a SECOND gate remains
Implemented the corrected pillar A (kernel.cpp, gated `REX_CPCOMPLETE`, default boot unregressed — verified): each vblank the pump decrements the pending-submission counter `device+0x2b04` by 1 (a faithful per-completion drain modeling GPU completion, NOT cont.15's blanket force-to-0 in the kick hook).

**Result (NOTOKEN+CSLEAK+MOVIE_EOF+XFLAG menu config):**
- **The kick-gate deadlock is BROKEN.** Kicks **6 → 14**, WPTR **37 → 61** (8 new frames submitted). The main thread **progresses past the render fence-wait** (sub_821C6E58) it was stuck in (cont.21 §5) — two gdb samples 6s apart show it in *different* functions (sub_82150970 → sub_821D5CA8/sub_821C48B0), i.e. **alive and cycling** through the render/game loop, not deadlocked. ✅ Confirms the corrected model: `device+0x2b04` IS the first gate; draining it (as a CP-completion result) flows the ring.
- **But a SECOND gate remains.** Kicks plateau at 14 / WPTR 61 (identical at 45s and 60s). All kicked IBs are SMALL state/setup buffers (len ≤266 dw, in the 0xA001xxxx/0xA011xxxx/0xA2014xxx windows); the big **content draw IB never appears** (prod's is 3592 dw @ phys 0x1dc90540 = guest 0xBDC90540), and still only `init=0x30088` rects, **0 textured draws**. So the title submits ~8 frames of setup then stops submitting — the counter-drain alone is necessary but not sufficient: the title needs the FULLER completion handshake (producer/consumer bookkeeping → command-buffer/resource recycling, and/or the segment-pointer fence sub_821C5DF0) before it keeps submitting content. (Open: also possible the forced MOVIE_EOF/XFLAG state isn't a genuine "menu up" — verify whether the title is actually at menu-content rendering in this config vs an attract/idle loop.)

⇒ **Pillar A advanced, not finished:** first gate (pending-counter) cracked + the second gate localized.

**Second-gate experiments (both NEGATIVE — the second gate is NOT another completion mechanism):**
- **CPCOMPLETE + PUMPCB** (counter-drain + drive producer/consumer with the real record ctx): kicks STILL 14, WPTR STILL 61, consumer drains once, 0 textured. ⇒ driving the producer/consumer does NOT make the title submit content — reconfirms it's bookkeeping, not the gate.
- **CPCOMPLETE on the NATURAL path** (NOTOKEN+CSLEAK only, NO MOVIE_EOF/XFLAG): IDENTICAL (kicks 14 / WPTR 61 / 0 textured) AND the title **reaches the frontend naturally — loads its menu shaders** (`media/shaders/Simple.xbv`, `SPTextured.xbv/.xbp`) — with **NO CRASH over 60s** (vs the documented render-SIGSEGV ~33s baseline). So the plateau is NOT a forced-state artifact; it's the genuine menu behavior.

⇒ **CONCLUSION: the second limit is the fundamental pillar-A↔pillar-B COUPLING.** The title reaches the menu + loads its render shaders, the counter-drain flows ~8 frames of setup IBs, but it will NOT submit the content draw IBs until it sees REAL GPU results (executed+rendered draws + real completion side-effects). You can't fully flow the ring (A) without rendering (B), and you can't render (B) without the ring flowing (A) — they must be built together. No completion-driving trick substitutes; this is the structural GPU-CP requirement, now proven from the title's own progression (not inferred).

**Bonus:** `REX_CPCOMPLETE` is a genuine improvement to keep — it flows the ring AND stabilizes the title (60s no-crash, reaches shader-load) where the prior baseline SIGSEGV'd ~33s. Good foundation for pillar B.

**NEXT (the real remaining work = pillar B + the coupling):** build the DRAW_INDX→Vulkan translator (VkPipeline from reg-file state + the now-loaded .updb shaders→SPIR-V + vertex-fetch + textures), wire it so executing a kicked submission produces a REAL completion (fence advance + counter decrement reflecting actual GPU work), and iterate the A↔B coupling so the title advances from setup IBs to content draw IBs. Run CPCOMPLETE as the ring-flow + stability base. Committed (gated, default-safe, NOT pushed).

## cont.22 (2026-06-04, autonomous) — ⭐ RE-GROUNDING cont.21: title is NOT at menu-content render (it's stuck in the frontend MOVIE/ATTRACT loop); ring-flow ≠ content; and the real crash is DISPATCH-TABLE corruption (the table lives in guest-WRITABLE space)

cont.21 concluded "second gate = pillar-A↔B coupling; build the PM4→Vulkan draw translator." Three independent measurements this session **correct that framing**: the title never reaches menu-content rendering at all, so there are no content draws to translate yet — the blocker is upstream, and the crash that limits every run is a memory-corruption bug in the harness, not a renderer gap.

### 1. The pending-counter device+0x2b04: variant-A RUNAWAY vs prod BOUNDED-at-1 (measured)
- Variant A, natural CPCOMPLETE path (`REX_KICKGATE`): **r3 == dev == g_interruptData == 0x26F80** (all the same object — CPCOMPLETE drains the *correct* counter; not a wrong-counter bug). The title is **NOT idle**: it calls the kick gate sub_821C6C80 **15,768×** (16 KICK + **15,752 DEFER**) — it *hammers* the submit path. `device+0x2b04` climbs monotonically 0→0xA+ because CPCOMPLETE drains **1/vblank (~60/s)** while the title increments **~7–8/vblank** (`[cpcomplete]` log shows the counter jump 1→9→16→24 between drains). The gate is permanently closed by a **drain-RATE mismatch**, NOT "the title stopped submitting" (cont.21's wording corrected).
- **Prod** (`tools/prod_counter.gdb`, break sub_821C6C80 / sub_821CC140 / sub_821CCA28; dev=0x40016f80): `device+0x2b04` oscillates **strictly 0↔1 — cmax=1 over 33,000 kick-gate samples** (hist {0:18019, 1:14981}, ~55% KICK), the decrement keeping per-submission pace. ⇒ the faithful pillar-A drain must be **per-submission (bounding ≤1)**, NOT 1/vblank. But see §2 — this does not unlock content.

### 2. Ring flow ≠ content (measured + cont.15)
Across all kick rates — 16 (natural, this session) and 2725 (forced-to-0, cont.15) — the title builds **only `init=0x30088` degenerate rects, 0 textured draws**. More ring flow does NOT produce content. The pending-counter is a solved-in-principle downstream lever; it is **not** the content gate.

### 3. cont.21's OPEN QUESTION resolved — the title is in the frontend MOVIE/ATTRACT loop, not the menu (measured backtrace)
gdb all-thread bt at the natural plateau — the **main thread**:
```
sub_82150970 (frontend) → sub_82222258 → sub_822132A0 → sub_82426E50 → sub_824267B0
  → sub_82425BF8 (the intro/attract MOVIE WIDGET) → sub_821BE680 → sub_821BDF00/DE40
  → sub_821C0A70 → sub_821C6E58 (GPU fence-wait) → sub_821B9270 (spin)
```
The main thread is **driving the movie widget and spinning on a GPU fence** — NOT at menu-content rendering. The "menu shaders loaded (Simple/SPTextured/SimpleCol/SpHud…)" is **precache** during the movie screen, not active menu draw. (cont.21's "reaches the menu" is overstated: it reaches the *frontend* but is stuck on the movie/attract screen.) The forced path (MOVIE_EOF+XFLAG, cont.7/21) gets *past* the movie but stalls at menu-SETUP null vtable sub_8215DE84 — also not content. **Neither path reaches menu-content rendering.**

⇒ cont.21's "build the PM4→Vulkan translator NOW" is **premature / out of order**: there are no content draws to translate because the title never gets to content rendering. (The translator is not *wrong* — prod's menu renders 54 pipelines, so variant A's menu will eventually need it — it's just next-after reaching the menu.)

### 4. The natural-path crash is OURS: DISPATCH-TABLE CORRUPTION (measured + root-caused)
The natural path crashes ~15–20s (NOT cont.21's "60s no-crash" — that was a lucky race outcome; the INDIRECT-NULL cascade is the cont.12(c9) race). Crash bt: **the VblankPump** → `FireGfxInterrupt(cb=0x821C7170, source=0/vblank) → CallGuest(0x821C7170)` → a garbage rip **0xffffffff40f62598**, with **no sub_821C7170 frame** — `DispatchLookup(0x821C7170)` *itself* returned the garbage. The dispatch-table slot for sub_821C7170 (called fine early, cont.13) is **corrupted**.

Direct gdb read of the table at the crash — **every sampled slot is garbage**:
```
sub_821C7170  slot=guest 0x82abe2e0  *slot=0xffffffff40f62598
sub_821C6600  slot=guest 0x82abcc00  *slot=0xffffffff00008f82
sub_82150970  slot=guest 0x829d12e0  *slot=0xffffffffffffffff
sub_821CC7A0  slot=guest 0x82ac8f40  *slot=0x0000000000000000
raw bytes @ slot:  98 25 f6 40 ff ff ff ff … 67 61 6d 65 3a 5c 6d 65 64 69 61 5c  = "game:\media\"
```
**ROOT CAUSE:** the dispatch table is placed at `g_base + PPC_IMAGE_BASE + PPC_IMAGE_SIZE = g_base + 0x82930000` — i.e. **inside the guest-writable 4 GiB mmap, immediately after the image** — and extends to 0x83311830 (CODE_SIZE·2, 1 PPCFunc* per 4 code bytes). The title's own **post-image runtime data** (file-path strings `"game:\media\…"`, floats, 0xFFFFFFFF sentinels) lands in [0x82930000, …) and **overwrites the table slots for its frontend/render functions** (measured corruption spans the slots for 0x82150970..0x821CC7A0). `DispatchLookup`/`PPC_LOOKUP_FUNC` then return garbage pointers that the unguarded `if (fn)` happily CALLED → SIGSEGV. **This is almost certainly the root of the long-standing render-path "string-as-code" / INDIRECT-NULL crashes (cont.10–21)** — this session also logged INDIRECT-NULL targets `0x67616D65`("game"), `0x6C6F6261`("Glob"), `0x41737365`("Asse"ts), `0x74735C47` at lr=0x82204D08 (the cont.12 string-as-code site), all path fragments interpreted as code.

### Fixes shipped (default-safe, default-boot verified unregressed)
- **(a) PPCInvokeGuest range bound: IMAGE_SIZE → CODE_SIZE.** The dispatch check admitted targets up to image_end (0x82930000), but the table only covers code_end (0x825F0C18); the [code_end, image_end) gap — where the title's vtables/rodata (0x826xxxx–0x828xxxx) live — indexed PAST the table into garbage. Correct latent bug, fixed.
- **(b) Host-fn-pointer validity guard (`ValidHostFn`).** Compute [lo,hi] of the recompiled fn pointers once from `PPCFuncMappings[]`; in BOTH `PPCInvokeGuest` and `CallGuest`, skip+log (`[DISPATCH-CORRUPT]` / `CallGuest: corrupt`) a looked-up pointer outside that range instead of calling it. Turns the corrupted-slot crash into a clean skip.
- **Verification:** default boot — 0 guard-fires, 0 device-overwrite, 30s no crash (unregressed). Natural path — under gdb it ran the **full 55s with NO crash while the guard caught 2107 corrupted-slot dispatches** (render-path sites lr=0x821BF834/0x821C84C0/0x821C8578). Non-gdb 3× sample: **2/3 survived 45s (guard caught 1515/1528)**, 1/3 still crashed (40 catches before a different-path fault). So the guard substantially improves stability (was always-crash ~15s) but is a **partial** mitigation — it catches the dispatch-READ crash class; it does NOT stop the corruption, and skipping a needed call can perturb downstream state.
- ⚠ **The complete fix = RELOCATE the dispatch table out of guest-usable space.** Either (best) put it in a SEPARATE host allocation (not inside g_base), or move its base from `PPC_IMAGE_BASE+PPC_IMAGE_SIZE` to a verified-unused guest region. Both touch `PPC_LOOKUP_FUNC` (ppc/ppc_context.h:113) + runtime.cpp:70 + kernel.cpp `DispatchLookup` → full recompile. The title's post-image data extends at least to ~0x82ac9000 (measured); pick the relocation target well clear of the title's data.

### NEXT (corrected priorities)
1. **Relocate the dispatch table** out of [0x82930000, …) (separate host allocation is cleanest) — the real fix for the corruption / string-as-code crash class; likely unblocks much of the render-path instability seen across cont.10–21.
2. **Reach the actual menu** (the true content-render gate): resolve the frontend movie/attract→menu transition — the movie GPU-fence sub_821C6E58 / movie EOS via the real VC-1 decoder + fair scheduler (the cont.9/10 Step-1 thread); or, on the forced path, recover the menu-setup null vtable sub_8215DE84 (cont.7).
3. **THEN** assess menu content draws and build pillar B (DRAW_INDX→Vulkan). The faithful pillar-A counter drain (per-submission, bounding ≤1 like prod) is a downstream lever, not the gate.

New tool: `tools/prod_counter.gdb` (prod device+0x2b04 oscillation + inc/dec rates — reusable). Committed (gated, default-safe, NOT pushed).

### cont.22 follow-up — dispatch table RELOCATED out of guest space (the REAL fix; corruption ELIMINATED)
Implemented the real fix flagged above. The dispatch table now lives in a **separate host `mmap`** (`g_funcTableBase`, runtime.cpp, `CODE_SIZE·2 + 4096` B), NOT at `g_base+0x82930000` inside the guest 4 GiB map. New `HostFnAt(guestAddr)` reads it (same byte layout: 1 PPCFunc* per 4 code bytes, indexed `(addr-CODE_BASE)*2`, out-of-range→null); `PPCInvokeGuest` and `DispatchLookup` use it. **Scope = runtime.cpp (alloc+populate) + kernel.cpp (read) + kernel.h (decl) only** — the recompiled TUs route indirect calls through `PPCInvokeGuest` (rex_indirect.h overrides `PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC`), so `PPC_LOOKUP_FUNC` / ppc/ppc_context.h are untouched → **no mass recompile** (2 TUs). The freed guest region `[0x82930000, 0x83311830)` becomes plain RAM for the title's post-image data.
- **✅ Corruption ELIMINATED.** Loader confirms `dispatch table at host 0x7f0f33cbf000 (0x9E2830 B, OUT of guest space)`. The cont.22 `ValidHostFn` guard now fires **0×** across every run (was 40–2107/run) — proof the table is no longer being overwritten. Default boot unregressed (0 device-overwrite, 25s no crash). Dispatch still correct (title reaches the same kicks=14 / 6 Lua-script loads).
- **Residual (separate, NOT corruption):** the natural path still crashes **intermittently** — non-gdb 3× = **2/3 survived 45s, 1/3 crashed with guardfires=0** (so NOT the table corruption); under gdb it ran 50s no-crash (race-timing). This is a DIFFERENT bug, previously masked by the corruption crash — almost certainly the **cont.12(c9) render-DPC race** (the pump-driven `sub_821BF748` dispatching a *stale pooled render-command object* field whose value happens to be an in-range valid fn → wrong dispatch → crash; ValidHostFn can't catch an in-range-valid pointer). That needs the real scheduler/sync (cont.9/10 Step-1), not a table fix.
- The cont.22 guards (CODE_SIZE bound + ValidHostFn + DISPATCH-CORRUPT/CallGuest-skip logging) are KEPT as a cheap defensive net + tripwire: post-relocation they should never fire; if `[DISPATCH-CORRUPT]` ever logs, something other than a guest store corrupted the table.

⇒ **Updated NEXT:** (1) ~~relocate table~~ ✅ DONE. (2) the residual render-DPC race (cont.12(c9)) — fix via real sync, OR continue toward the menu (movie/attract→menu transition). (3) reach the actual menu = the true content gate; THEN pillar B (DRAW_INDX→Vulkan). Commit (default-safe, NOT pushed).

### cont.22 loop-iter — the corruption fix UNBLOCKED the forced menu-setup path (sub_8215DE84 gone)
Re-tested the **forced path** (`REX_MOVIE_EOF=120 REX_XFLAG=1` — the cont.7 config) with the relocated build: **0 crash over 55s, guardfires=0, and the ONLY INDIRECT-NULL is the benign `0x82292D08`.** cont.7's menu-setup blocker `[INDIRECT-NULL] 0xFFFFFFFF @ sub_8215DE84` (`0x8215DE84` — squarely IN the corrupted slot window `0x82150970..0x821CC7A0`) is **GONE** — it was the dispatch-table corruption, not a genuinely missing function. The title now runs **stably in the frontend movie/attract loop**: intro → (forced EOS) → attract (`towerDefense_attract_movie.wmv` decoding, buf18 `varied`), movie-EOS completions posting (`sub_8222A9F8` ×3), loads `Strings.bin` — but **NO menu content**. ⇒ **the corruption fix removed a major crash class (very likely several of the cont.10–21 render-path crashes); the remaining blocker to menu content is the attract→menu TRANSITION logic (cont.7's `sub_82163118` advance / the `sub_8211B740`→`sub_8210AF90` screen-state divergence), independent of the corruption and of the renderer.** NEXT: RE the attract→menu transition — why `sub_82163118` doesn't advance despite forced EOS + XFLAG + the posted completion. (Probe note: a run-to-SIGKILL gdb script can't print after `run`; count from inside the breakpoint handlers + print periodically.)

### cont.22 loop-iter 2 — ⚠ CORRECTION + the REAL menu-setup frontier reached (forced + START → sub_8215DE84 0xFFFFFFFF)
Probed the transition (gdb counters, in-handler prints) on the forced path and CORRECTED the prior note:
- **Transition map (forced, no START):** `sub_82163118` (advance) fires **exactly once** (intro→attract); `sub_82161920` (intro screen machine) runs 168× then freezes (intro screen ended — normal); `sub_82150770` (attract owner, obj 0x827f4d8c) spins hot (12600+); `sub_8210AF90` (the REAL transitions-enabler) **never runs** (=0) — so XFLAG is still required; the tid=10 worker path (sub_82250420→sub_8211B740→sub_8210AF90) is still blocked even post-corruption-fix (cont.8 starvation persists). Movie-EOS posts 3× but only the FIRST advances ⇒ **attract→menu is NOT movie-EOS-driven.**
- **Forced + START (REX_SKIPINTRO):** `sub_82163118` fires a **2nd time** (attract→menu) → the title **enters menu-setup: allocates menu buffers** (`MmAllocatePhysicalMemoryEx sz=0x195000 + 0x3000 + 0x10000`) → then **`[INDIRECT-NULL] target=0xFFFFFFFF @ sub_8215DE84`**, and goes quiet (no crash, owner loop drops to ~200). 
- **⚠ CORRECTS commit b99953d:** I claimed "sub_8215DE84 was the dispatch-table corruption, gone." WRONG. The no-START path simply **never reaches** sub_8215DE84 (it loops attract, advance stays 1). With START the title advances to menu-setup and **DOES hit sub_8215DE84** — and it's the GENUINE cont.7 blocker: `target=0xFFFFFFFF` = an **uninitialized object vtable/jump-table slot** read as a call target (cleanly range-skipped by PPCInvokeGuest), **distinct from the table corruption** (which produced garbage HOST pointers). The corruption fix is still a real win (removed the render-path crash class), but it did NOT remove sub_8215DE84. (Lesson: I inferred "gone" from absence in one config instead of testing the path that reaches it.)
- **⇒ REAL menu frontier (now reached cleanly):** forced+START gets the title INTO menu-setup; the blocker is **sub_8215DE84's 0xFFFFFFFF uninit object** (recover its vtable/construction like cont.12 recovered the null singleton via the pool fix + prod oracle). Run-base for menu-setup work: `REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=120 REX_XFLAG=1 REX_SKIPINTRO=1`. NEXT: RE sub_8215DE84 (prod-oracle: what object/vtable does it call; who constructs it; why null in variant A).

### cont.22 loop-iter 3 — sub_8215DE84 localized (forced-path artifact), and the natural transition is STILL blocked at sub_8211B740 (NOT corruption)
RE'd the sub_8215DE84 blocker + tested the natural path with the corruption-fixed build:
- **sub_8215DE84 decoded:** `lr=0x8215DE84` is the return of a DIRECT `bl sub_824253C8(r3=stackbuf)` from frontend menu-setup `loc_8215DE70` — taken only when `*(r31+216)!=0` (a STATE-dependent branch). `sub_824253C8` loads a callback ptr from a `.data` table at **`0x828183A0`**, null-checks `==0`, and tail-calls it. In variant A `*(0x828183A0)=0xFFFFFFFF` (an uninit "not-registered" sentinel) — which the `==0` check doesn't catch → it tail-calls `0xFFFFFFFF` (INDDUMP: tgt=0xFFFFFFFF, r11=0xFFFFFFFF, obj r31=0x060FF800). So a callback at `0x828183A0` is unregistered in variant A.
- **BUT likely a FORCED-PATH ARTIFACT:** prod oracle breaking on `sub_824253C8` (symbol resolved @0xec65b0) got **0 hits in 70s** (prod under gdb's SIGSEGV-write-watch is slow — inconclusive, but the branch is `*(r31+216)`-gated state divergence, and the title is in the forced MOVIE_EOF+XFLAG+SKIPINTRO state prod never enters). Per cont.8/cont.10 ("XFLAG is a crutch; the real path is the NATURAL movie→EOF→advance"), chasing forced-path branches = whack-a-mole. Did NOT pursue the 0x828183A0 registration.
- **⭐ Decisive natural-path test (FAIRSCHED + CPCOMPLETE, corruption-fixed build):** the decoder (sub_82339428), tid=10 loop (sub_82250420), and worker (sub_8211B740) each START — but **sub_8211B740 STILL diverges before sub_8210AF90**: ENABLER(8210AF90)=0, advance(82163118)=0 (0 crash, 0 guardfires). ⇒ **the corruption fix does NOT unblock the natural transition.** The render-path crash class is gone (real win), but the intro→menu transition is gated by the **genuine cont.11 `sub_8211B740` branch divergence** (a state/data divergence in the 718-line handler, ONE of its ~7 indirect calls under ~6 branches goes the wrong way) — separate from the corruption.
- **⇒ NEXT (the real transition frontier):** trace `sub_8211B740`'s branch path with **REX_TRACEB740** (already in PPCInvokeGuest — logs every indirect call from sub_8211B740 + its return value) under FAIRSCHED, diff vs the prod oracle (prod reaches sub_8210AF90 via sub_8211B740+0x1220), find the FIRST diverging branch + its input state = the fix target. This is the cont.11 thread, now reachable cleanly (no corruption masking).

### cont.22 loop-iter 4 — sub_8211B740 traced; the transition block is a WORKER WAIT, not a branch divergence (cont.12 frontier reconfirmed)
- **REX_TRACEB740 (FAIRSCHED):** sub_8211B740 makes 2 indirect calls — `lr=0x8211B7D4→sub_82118E10 (r3=1)`, `lr=0x8211B804→sub_82248F18 (r3=0x0133F260)` — then takes the `r3!=0` branch into a DIRECT call `sub_8211BC40` (untraced) and continues. So the 2-entry trace is NOT "it stopped"; the handler continues via direct calls.
- **gdb all-thread bt (FAIRSCHED, ~22s):** the VC-1 decoder thread is actively running (simde_mm_shuffle_epi8 SIMD ✓ — FAIRSCHED decodes), but **nearly every other guest thread is BLOCKED in a Ke*Wait / FairWaitUntil / condition_variable::wait** (KeWaitForSingleObject obj=171220/171328, KeWaitForMultipleObjects, NtWaitForMultipleObjectsEx — all on `g_objCv`, several timeoutMs=-1 infinite). The sub_8211B740 worker (tid=10) is among them: after its early calls it **blocks on an unmet event**, so it never runs far enough to reach sub_8210AF90.
- **⇒ Refines cont.11→cont.12:** the intro→menu transition is NOT a simple sub_8211B740 branch divergence — it's the **cont.12 frontier** ("threads WAIT on unmet conditions/signals, not CPU starvation"), and the **corruption fix does not change it** (it removed the crashes that used to mask this, so the wait is now reached cleanly). This is the deep cont.8–12 wall (prior multi-session). **NEXT (focused, hard):** identify the SPECIFIC Ke event the transition worker blocks on (obj handle → who should KeSetEvent it in prod, and why variant A never does) — title-specific RE, the genuine remaining blocker to the natural intro→menu transition. The corruption fix + render-path-crash elimination stand as this session's durable win; the transition is a separate, deep frontier.

### cont.22 loop-iter 5 — the transition wait DECODED: an async-completion state-poll, coupled to the GPU/resource-completion gap (the unifying root)
Full worker backtrace (FAIRSCHED, the tid=10 thread) + source decode — REVISES iter 4 ("unmet Ke event" was imprecise):
- **Worker stack (Thread 5):** `sub_82250420 → sub_8211B740(:11122) → sub_82118E10 → sub_82249CC0 → sub_8224A660 → sub_8224A758 → sub_8224F890 → sub_8224F918 → sub_822481E0 → sub_82448B98 → sub_824500A8 → KeDelayExecutionThread`. It is NOT parked on a Ke event — it is in a **delay-poll loop**. (The sub_82249/sub_8224A frames are the render-SUBMIT area mapped in cont.13.)
- **The poll loop (sub_822481E0, decoded):** `while (*(r30+136) != 1 && *(r30+136) != 12) { (*(r31-4412))->vtable[8](); KeDelayExecutionThread(10); }`. So the transition-init **waits for an async operation's state `*(r30+136)` to reach 1 or 12 (done)**, pumping the subsystem via a virtual method (obj=*(r31-4412), vtable+32) each 10ms. In variant A the op never completes → infinite poll → the worker never reaches sub_8210AF90 → no transition.
- **⭐ UNIFYING INSIGHT:** this async-completion wait sits in the render-submit area (sub_82249CC0…), so it is very likely **the SAME GPU/resource-completion gap** that gates content rendering — i.e. the transition is NOT a separate logic problem, it's coupled to variant A's core "no real GPU/async completion" requirement (cont.21 RENDERER-DESIGN's faithful-CP). The 5 diagnostic iterations have RULED OUT the alternatives (corruption [fixed], forced-path artifacts [dead-end], branch divergence [no], unmet Ke event [no]) and converged on: **the transition, menu content, and pillar B are all gated on real GPU/async completion.** The corruption fix removed the crash confound that masked this; the clean gate is now visible.
- **NEXT:** (a) identify the async subsystem (obj=*(r31-4412)) + what sets `*(r30+136)` to 1/12 in prod (the completion) — GPU op vs async resource-I/O; (b) if a clean injection point exists, force the completion state as a diagnostic stopgap to SEE PAST the transition (does the menu then render content? = the pillar-B precondition test); (c) the real fix = the faithful GPU/async-completion model (the big cont.21 work that gates everything).

### cont.22 loop-iter 6 — the transition's async state machine PINNED (REX_POLLDIAG); a force-past stopgap does NOT work
Added **REX_POLLDIAG** (gated, default boot unregressed): logs the live ctx at the poll's pump call (guest lr=0x82248224, where frame-reads of the blocked worker fail — non-volatiles save/restore down the chain). Results:
- **The async object + driver, PINNED:** the pumped subsystem is a **static singleton** obj=`0x826574E8` (in .data), vtable=`0x820DAE34` (in .rdata), pump = `vtable[+32]` = **`sub_82247F98`**; the state field is at the fixed guest addr **`0x82657600`** (r30=0x82657578, +136; r31=0x828F0000, obj=*(r31-4412)). The pump is called every 10ms from sub_822481E0.
- **The state CYCLES, never completes:** `*(0x82657600)` runs **2→3→6→8→10→2→3→6…** every run — it processes stages but **loops back to 2 instead of advancing to the done-state {1,12}**. So the transition poll spins forever because the async op (driven by sub_82247F98) can't finish.
- **Force-past stopgap FAILS (REX_POLLFORCE, then removed):** forcing `*(0x82657600)=1` + skipping the pump did NOT clear the poll — the state **re-cycled** (the op is robustly driven; the forced incomplete result is overwritten/breaks the worker) and the title **stalled** (~780 lines, never reached the menu, sub_8210AF90=0, 0 crash). ⇒ **a fence-forward-style stopgap does NOT substitute for real completion here** (reconfirms the cont.21 lesson). Removed the hack; kept POLLDIAG as a reusable diagnostic.
- **NEXT:** RE **`sub_82247F98`** (the pump/state-machine) — decode the 2→3→6→8→10 stages and the condition that resets 10→2 instead of →12 (what unmet input loops it); AND identify the subsystem via the prod oracle (what class owns vtable `0x820DAE34` — GPU/render vs async resource/IO). That condition is the concrete completion variant A must drive — the next, well-pinned step toward the unified GPU/async-completion fix.

### cont.22 loop-iter 7 — the transition state machine MAPPED END-TO-END (a render/resource async-task manager)
Walked the chain from the poll down to the leaf state machine (vtable dump via gdb + recomp source):
- **The class** (singleton 0x826574E8, vtable `0x820DAE34`): 16-entry vtable with methods across 0x82100xxx / 0x82106xxx / 0x82248xxx and **`vtable[15]=sub_821B3B30` in the GPU/render range (0x821Bxxxx)** — so this is a **render/resource subsystem manager**. `vtable[8]=sub_82247F98` (the pump) is a thin shim → `vtable[13]=sub_82248738` (the driver).
- **The driver `sub_82248738`:** iterates **20 children** (each 216 B, at obj+144+i·216) calling `sub_82248010` (the per-child pump) on each. The poll watches **child[0]**'s state at obj+280 = `0x82657600`.
- **The per-child state machine `sub_82248010` (283 lines):** a staged async processor. Each stage makes a **polymorphic virtual sub-op call** (`PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC`) and branches on its returned status: **`==2` ⇒ WAIT (don't advance)**, **`==3` ⇒ ADVANCE** to the next stage (2→3→6→8→10→…), with done-states 1/12. The observed 2→3→6→8→10→2 cycle = the stages keep advancing (sub-ops return 3) but the op **resets instead of finishing** — i.e. an underlying async resource (file-stream I/O or a GPU op) the leaf sub-ops poll **never signals "done"**, so the 20 child tasks loop forever and child[0] never reaches 1/12.
- **⇒ Same root, fully mapped:** the intro→menu transition is gated on this render/resource async-task manager completing, which is gated on real async/GPU completion — exactly the unified root from iter 5. **The 7 diagnostic iterations have now characterized the frontier end-to-end.** The remaining work is no longer diagnosis: it's the **faithful async/GPU-completion model** (cont.21 RENDERER-DESIGN) — a large, multi-session engineering build, not a single loop iteration. **NEXT (the last useful disambiguation):** trace ONE leaf sub-op (its target + what it polls) to classify I/O-completion (possibly a tractable async-read-completion fix) vs GPU-completion (the big build). Then commit to the build.

### cont.22 loop-iter 8 — leaf sub-ops classified: a deeply-polymorphic RESOURCE LOADER (file-streaming works; the GPU resource-creation step is the gate)
Added **REX_TASKDIAG** (gated, default boot unregressed): logs the polymorphic sub-op calls inside sub_82248010 (lr in [0x82248010,0x82248260)) + their returned status. Results:
- The sub-op targets: `sub_822485A0` (returns **file sizes** — 612=Simple.xbv, plus 552/478/372/9178/329453, matching the NtQueryInformationFile sizes), `sub_82105948` (`return *(obj+208)` — a getter, →1), `sub_822484E0` (→ sub_8244D018, a kernel/IO call), `sub_822484D0` (returns a pointer — getter), and the pump itself. Every layer is a **virtual dispatch** (sub_822485A0 itself just forwards to `obj->vtable[3]`).
- ⇒ This is a **deeply-abstracted resource-loading framework** streaming the menu's assets (the .xbv/.xbp shaders). **File I/O works** (the files are tiny — Simple.xbv is 612 B — and read synchronously fine), yet the 20-child loader **cycles forever** ⇒ the blocker is NOT the file read; it's the step AFTER the read — **GPU resource CREATION** (shader/texture upload/compile) — which variant A's stub CP never completes. So the classification resolves to **GPU-completion**, with file-streaming as a working precursor.
- **⇒ The diagnostic phase is COMPLETE (8 iters).** The intro→menu transition, the menu content, and pillar B are ALL gated on the one root: a faithful GPU resource-creation + completion model. There is no quick stopgap (iter 6 proved force-past fails) and no tractable I/O shortcut (I/O already works). The remaining work is the **cont.21 RENDERER-DESIGN build** — a real PM4/GPU command processor that creates resources + signals completion — a large, multi-session engineering effort, not a loop iteration. Reusable diagnostics left in place: REX_POLLDIAG, REX_TASKDIAG (+ prod_counter.gdb). **Decision point: commit to the GPU-completion build.**

## cont.22 GPU BUILD (user chose "Start the GPU build") — piece 1: graphics-pipeline foundation ✅
The diagnostic phase converged on: variant A needs a real GPU resource-creation/draw + completion model. The user opted to build it. Going incrementally, committing each piece.

### Completion-poll spec pinned (loop-iter 8 follow-up, REX_POLLDIAG extended)
The transition's per-child completion poll = `child[0]->vtable[9]` = **sub_82105948** = `return *(child+208)` (child[0] vtable = 0x820DAE0C). The final stage (sub_82248010 loc_8224818C) treats that return as 2=pending / 3=advance / else=done. So the completion field is `*(child+208)`; but TASKDIAG saw it =1 (done) at times while the loader still cycles ⇒ the full multi-child completion is genuinely complex (not a single field to force) — confirming the faithful CP, not field-forcing, is the path.

### ✅ Piece 1 — the graphics pipeline foundation (runtime/vulkan_render.cpp, gated REX_DRAWTEST)
Added the machinery the DRAW_INDX→Vulkan translator plugs into (the present path was clear/blit only):
- **VkRenderPass** (one color attachment, clear→present), **per-image VkImageViews + VkFramebuffers** (recreated on swapchain change), a **VkPipeline** (no vertex input, dynamic viewport/scissor) from real SPIR-V shaders. Shader toolchain extended: wrote a generic `test.vert` + `test.frag` (tools/shaderc/ported/), compiled via shadercc, **embedded as `runtime/test_shaders.h`** (uint32 SPIR-V; the .updb fragment shaders are already compiled in tools/shaderc/out/).
- **PresentOnce** gains a `REX_DRAWTEST` path: begin render pass → bind pipeline → `vkCmdDraw(3)` → end → present (render pass handles UNDEFINED→PRESENT layout). + REX_RENDER_SHOT capture.
- **VERIFIED:** `REX_RENDER=1 REX_DRAWTEST=1 REX_FAIRSCHED=1` renders a clean RGB-gradient triangle (1280×720, RADV POLARIS11), **1500+ frames, 0 Vulkan errors, 0 crashes**; in-engine PPM capture → /tmp/varianta_triangle.png. **Default boot + the existing movie/clear present are UNREGRESSED** (all new code gated behind REX_DRAWTEST). This is the first thing variant A's own graphics pipeline has rendered.
- **NEXT pieces (toward the real renderer):** (2) wire the title's `DRAW_INDX` (in ExecutePM4) to a pipeline built from the reg-file state (vertex-fetch reg 0x4800 → vertex/index buffers, ALU reg 0x4000 → uniforms, the bound .updb shader→SPIR-V) → vkCmdDraw into an offscreen RT; (3) render-target/state translation; (4) the resource-creation + completion path so the title's loader (the transition) sees real GPU results. Piece 1 is the foundation all of these use.

### Piece 2 (decode) + ⭐ build-order finding: the draws reaching the CP are DEGENERATE — content is gated on the transition (piece 4 first)
Added **REX_DRAWDECODE** (gated): decodes each DRAW_INDX's prim type + vertex-fetch constants (the 0x4800 space, 2-dword entries, type 3 = kVertex per rexglue xenos.h) — the geometry the translator must upload. Measured (natural path NOTOKEN+CSLEAK+CPCOMPLETE):
- Every draw reaching the CP is **`init=0x10081` = a single-vertex POINT draw with 0 vertex buffers** — degenerate, no geometry. (The forced path's were `init=0x30088` = kRectangleList 2D rects — also just setup/clears.) So across all paths, only **setup/clear draws** reach the CP; the textured **menu content draws never do** — they're built only once the title is at the live menu, which is past the transition.
- ⇒ **The draw translator (piece 2) cannot be validated until content draws exist, which requires the transition to be unblocked. So the BUILD ORDER is: piece 4 (the transition / resource-creation completion) FIRST, then pieces 2–3 against real menu content.** Piece 1's pipeline + the piece-2 decoder are ready for when content arrives. **NEXT: piece 4 — pin what sets the loader's completion field `*(child+208)` to "done" in prod (hardware watchpoint on guest 0x82657648 → its writer), then drive that completion in variant A → unblock intro→menu.**

### Piece 4 — ⭐ divergence TRACED (prod + variant-A hardware watchpoints): the child state machine COMPLETES; a per-frame processor RESETS it (the queue never drains)
Hardware watchpoints on the loader's state field (guest 0x82657600 = child[0]+136) and completion field (0x82657648 = child[0]+208), armed at the title entry, in BOTH prod (base 0x100000000) and variant A:
- **PROD child[0]: state 2→3→1 (done).** The completion field `*(child+208)` is set to **1 (ready)** by **sub_822484D0** (called from sub_82248010); the state-3 handler `sub_82248010` reads it via vtable[9]=sub_82105948 (`= *(child+208)` = 1, ≠2/≠3) → `loc_822480A8` → state **1 (done)**. The loader drains.
- **VARIANT A child[0]: the state machine ALSO reaches done** — `sub_82248010` writes state 3→**1**, and `*(child+208)=1` (SAME as prod), so the per-child completion logic WORKS. **BUT then `sub_8224F918` (← sub_8224F890 ← sub_82253540 / sub_8224A758 ← the frontend `sub_8214FFD0`) RESETS the completed child's state (1→6, 1→0) and `sub_82248480` re-inits it to 2** — so the loader RE-PROCESSES forever. The observed 2→3→6→8→10→2 "cycle" is this **reset loop**, not a stuck child.
- ⇒ **The blocker is NOT the per-child state machine (it completes correctly, identically to prod); it's the loader's per-frame queue PROCESSOR `sub_8224F918`, driven from the frontend (`sub_8214FFD0`), which keeps finding work to re-submit in variant A but drains in prod. The resource QUEUE never empties.** This moves the frontier UP from the (working) child state machine to the queue/processor that re-feeds it.
- **NEXT: why `sub_8224F918` keeps re-submitting** — what feeds the resource queue + its drain/empty condition (trace `sub_8224F918` / `sub_82253540` / the frontend `sub_8214FFD0`: does prod's queue go empty while variant A's keeps getting entries? what enqueues them?). That empty/drain condition is the real root of the intro→menu transition block. (Tools: prod + variant-A state-field hardware-watchpoint gdb scripts — armed at entry, base from $rsi.)

### cont.22 GPU BUILD — piece 3a (draw-state extraction) + ⭐ RE-GROUNDING: the resource-queue rabbit-hole (loop-iter 6-8 / piece 4) was pre-MOVIE_EOF; NOTOKEN+MOVIE_EOF reaches the FULL menu → the real gate is cont.21's A↔B coupling
**Measured this iteration (NOT inferred):**
- **Most-advanced STABLE state found = `REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`** (post dispatch-table-fix): **620k lines/30s, NO crash, 0 dispatch-corruption, 0 device-overwrite**, and it loads the **ENTIRE menu/HUD shader set** — Simple, SimpleCol, SPBackdropTextured, SPBackdropUntextured, SPBuildStructure, SpDropShadow, SPHud{GrayScale,ImageBar,Rectangle}, SpHudWithMask, … This is real menu-content asset loading, far past the movie loop.
- ⇒ **The loop-iter 6-8 / piece-4 conclusion ("the resource queue `sub_8224F918` never drains") was config-specific** (no MOVIE_EOF → the loader waits on the still-playing movie's resources). **`REX_MOVIE_EOF=30` ends the movie → the loader DRAINS and loads the full menu.** The resource loader was never permanently stuck; it was gated on the movie. This UNIFIES piece-4 with cont.21: past the movie, the real gate is the **A↔B coupling**, not the resource queue.
- **A↔B coupling RE-CONFIRMED at this most-advanced state** (matches cont.21 exactly): `[kick]`=**14** (plateau), `[ringdump]` shows the 14 kicked IBs are all **setup** (max len=266 dw; prod's content draws live in a 3592-dw IB, never kicked here), `[VdSwap]`×6 but **every framebuffer is all-zeros (black)**, `[fencefwd]`×**17233** (the stopgap fakes GPU completion → limps through menu LOGIC but SUPPRESSES content-draw submission), `[cpcomplete]` climbs to **660→659** (the cont.22 RATE-mismatch: title increments ~7-8/vblank, drain is 1/vblank → kick-gate `counter==0` rarely opens → kicks plateau). `[swapbuf]` carries the WAIT_REG_MEM/callback handshake records (`821BF860`, `0000057C`) = the producer/consumer bookkeeping cont.21 closed as a dead-end.
- ⚠ **cont.22 re-grounding point 4 ("translator premature, no path reaches menu-content") is CORRECTED in part, STANDS in part:** the menu IS reachable (via MOVIE_EOF — corrects "no path reaches the menu"), BUT only clears/setup reach the CP, no textured content (the A↔B gate stands). So the translator is justified to BUILD (the user's "Start the GPU build"), but content to translate awaits the A↔B break.

**sub_8215DE84 (forced-path terminal blocker) ROOT-CAUSED — NOT a recompiler gap, NOT table-corruption:** the `lr=0x8215DE84` site is a *direct* `bl sub_824253C8` (ppc_recomp.7.cpp:16280). `sub_824253C8` (ppc_recomp.59.cpp:21119) loads a global **function-pointer at `0x829183A0`** (`= 0x82920000 − 31840`) and tail-calls it via `bctr`; its null-check only catches `0`, but the slot holds **`0xFFFFFFFF`** (an uninitialized registration sentinel) → dispatches into `0xFFFFFFFF`. So it's a **registration slot the title never populated on the forced path** (a subsystem registers its handler into `0x829183A0`; that registration didn't run). The dispatch-table relocation did NOT clear it (it's a guest global, not the host fn-table) — confirmed: forced path still fires it, table-guard 0×, no crash (the INDIRECT-NULL is skipped). Forced/cooperative path is also scheduler-starved (97% `KeGetCurrentProcessType` spin) ⇒ NOTOKEN, not the forced/cooperative path, is the productive one.

**✅ Piece 3a — draw-state extraction (runtime/kernel.cpp DRAW_INDX handler, gated `REX_DRAWSTATE=N`, default boot unregressed):** reads the pipeline state a real draw binds from the CP's register file (`0x7FC80000 + reg*4`, populated by SET_CONSTANT) — RB_SURFACE_INFO(0x2000)/RB_COLOR_INFO(0x2001) (RT pitch/msaa/format/base), PA_CL_VPORT_*(0x210F-0x2112) (viewport w/h from scale, offset), PA_SC_WINDOW_SCISSOR_TL/BR(0x2081/2), RB_BLENDCONTROL0(0x2201)/RB_COLORCONTROL(0x2202), PA_SU_SC_MODE_CNTL(0x2205), SQ_PROGRAM_CNTL(0x2180), RB_MODECONTROL(0x2208). Reg numbers per rexglue `register_table.inc`. **Result (the only 3 draws reaching the CP, all identical):** `RECT-list numInd=3 | RT pitch=640 msaa=0 colorFmt=0 colorBase=0x0 | vp 640x-368 off(320,184) | scissor (0,0)-(8192,8192) | blend0=0x10001 colorCtl=0x0 progCntl=0x10010001 suMode=0x10000 mode=0x4`. Decoded: **full-viewport opaque RGBA8 rect fills to a 640×368 EDRAM-base-0 surface, src=One/dst=Zero (opaque), trivial shaders (vs=1/ps=0 regs), mode=4=kColorDepth** ⇒ these init=0x30088 rects are **clears/background fills, NOT menu content** — the A↔B coupling confirmed at the draw-state level.

**Verify:** default boot 170k lines/18s, 0 crash, 0 `[drawstate]` leak (gated off), 0 dispatch-corrupt, 0 device-overwrite, reaches intro. Commit cont.22 (gated, default-safe, NOT pushed).

**NEXT (the A↔B break is the gate; translator has no content until it breaks):** the central unanswered question for breaking A↔B = **WHICH fence does the title spin on (`sub_821C6E58` r4/r5 target) and why doesn't the CP's faithful EVENT_WRITE_SHD execution of the kicked IBs produce it** — that gap IS the content the title isn't kicking. Now testable fresh (post table-fix, at the stable full-menu state, which cont.13-21 predate). Then build piece 3 (DRAW_INDX→vkCmdDraw) so that when content IBs kick, they render. Run-base: `REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`. New diag: `REX_DRAWSTATE=N`.

### cont.22 GPU BUILD — A↔B coupling DECISIVELY confirmed at the full-menu state: content is NOT built anywhere; all faking exhausted ⇒ pillar B (real rendering) is the only path
Ran 5 measurements at the most-advanced stable state (`REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`, post table-fix — which cont.13-21 predate):
- **Fence dynamics (`[fencewait]`):** the completion-fence head climbs **17→1439** (title builds ~6 fences/frame for ~240 frames) and the command-build cursor (device+13568..13572) grows **~32 MB** — but only **14 tiny IBs are kicked** (≤266 dw). So the title builds a large deferred tail it relies on the real GPU to auto-flush; variant A's CP only executes kicked IBs. The steady gap (tgt = head−8, cur = tgt−6) is bridged by fence-forward.
- **`sub_8211B740` (transition handler) runs but does NOT reach `sub_8210AF90`** (`REX_TRACEB740`): it makes 4 indirect calls (0x8211B7D4 loop, 0x8211B804 vtable, 0x8211BE60, 0x8211BE98 — all into the resource-loader/task-manager `sub_82248xxx`/`sub_8224FB68` family) and exits, skipping the mid-function call sites where the `sub_8210AF90` dispatch lives ⇒ the transitions-enabled flag 0x828E82A6 stays 0.
- **⭐ DECISIVE 1 — forcing the transition flag (`REX_XFLAG`) does NOT yield content:** at the full-menu state, +XFLAG still produces **exactly 3 RECT clears, 14 kicks, 0 non-rect draws** (it only diverts the title to a different blocker, the 0x82292D08 null-singleton). So the transition flag is **not** the content gate — refutes "transition is the prerequisite."
- **⭐ DECISIVE 2 — clean segment census (`REX_CHUNKDUMP=3`, now firing at the full-menu state — was gated n>=4000 which few-swap menu never reaches):** following the device+13568 descriptors {0x81LLLLLL,phys}→guest=0xA0000000|(addr&0x1FFFFFFF), all **11 segments = realDraws=0 rectDraws=0 texFetch=0** — pure state/events/callbacks (SET_CONSTANT, C0004600 COND_WRITE, the `0001057C 821CC7A0` producer-callback record). **No draws at all** in the directory. Confirms cont.10/12 at the most-advanced state.
- **`REX_CHUNKCP` (execute the chunk as inline PM4) is contaminated** — the chunk is a DIRECTORY not inline PM4, so parsing it as PM4 misparses the 0xC1xxxxxx descriptor words as fake DRAW_INDX (the `numInd=49152`/garbage-state rows). Not a valid content test (cont.10's false-positive warning).

**⇒ A↔B coupling, now multiply-confirmed with clean evidence:** content draws are NOT built in the ring IBs (only clears) NOR the device+13568 directory (zero draws); and NEITHER faking the transition (XFLAG) NOR faking completion (fence-forward/CPCOMPLETE/counter) makes the title build them. The title genuinely won't BUILD content until it observes a REAL GPU result from rendering what it HAS submitted (the clears/setup). **All faking is exhausted ⇒ the only path is pillar B: render the kicked clears/setup FOR REAL and advance the swap/fence as a genuine result** (the user's "Start the GPU build" + cont.21 "A+B together").

**⚠ Open sub-question before the big pillar-B build:** since the title reads the swap-counter/fence from memory (which faking already sets to the same values), the "real result" it needs must be something faking can't reproduce — most likely a **surface readback or an occlusion (ZPASS_DONE) query result** that only real pixel rendering produces. NEXT: (a) check whether the title issues ZPASS_DONE queries / reads back EDRAM after the clears (PM4 scan + watch the readback address) — that pins the exact real-result gate; then (b) piece 3b: real DRAW_INDX→vkCmdDraw of the clears into a Vulkan RT + present, producing that result. Tool added: `REX_CHUNKDUMP=N` (configurable census trigger swap#). Run-base: `REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`.

## cont.22 (2026-06-04, autonomous /loop) — 🟢🟢🟢 BREAKTHROUGH: the content IS built — the cont.10-22 "content not built anywhere" was a CENSUS-PARSER ARTIFACT; the A↔B-coupling premise is FALSE
Step (a) (the result-gate scan) was meant to gate piece 3b. It did far more: it **overturned the central blocker** of the last ~12 continuations. The device+13568 deferred segments contain full, walker-verified menu content; variant A's CP simply never executes them.

### How the artifact was found (chain of measurements, all at the stable full-menu state `REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`)
1. **Built step-(a) diagnostics** (`REX_RESULTSCAN` on the kicked CP stream + extended the `REX_CHUNKDUMP` directory census with result-gate counts). Constants from rexglue `xenos.h`/`register_table.inc`: ZPASS_DONE=event 21, EVENT_WRITE_ZPD=0x5b, VIZ_QUERY=0x23, WAIT_REG_MEM=0x3c, REG_TO_MEM=0x3e, RB_COPY_*=regs 0x2318-0x2325, COHER_STATUS_HOST=reg 0xA31, PA_SC_VIZ_QUERY=0x2293.
2. **Kicked-stream `[result]` scan (measured):** the WAIT_REG_MEMs the CP executes are all bookkeeping — `reg:0xA31`(COHER_STATUS_HOST, mask bit-31, trivially satisfied since variant A's reg file is 0) and the producer/consumer handshake `mem:0x2011012==0x821CC7A0`(producer cb) / `mem:0x2011016==<ctx 0xC00901801>` / `mem:0x2011002==4/0`. No occlusion, no resolve in the kicked stream. So far this *seemed* to confirm "no pixel-result gate" → it briefly looked like the night-log's surface-readback/ZPASS hypothesis was refuted.
3. **The census initially agreed** (zpass=0 viz=0 resolve=0, realDraws=0) — BUT the census truncated each segment at **1024 dwords** and **only advanced type-3 packets by their count** (every type-0/1/2 packet advanced by a single dword). The larger content segments are **0xCDC-0xF68 dwords (3292-3944)** and begin with long runs of zeros / type-0 register loads — so the truncation hid everything past dword 1024 and the type-0 misalignment fabricated/missed packets. **This is exactly cont.10's "brute-scan gives false positives" warning — but it cut BOTH ways: it also produced false NEGATIVES that propagated as the "0 draws" conclusion through cont.10/12/21/22.**
4. **Removed the 1024 cap** → draws/resolves/viz appeared, but with the still-broken type-3-only walker (suspect).
5. **Rewrote the census walker to be CORRECT** (mirror `ExecutePM4`: advance type-0 by reg count, type-1 by 2, type-2 by 0, type-3 by data count) **+ added DESYNC detection** (a clean PM4 stream parses to its end; a misparse overruns). **Result: the content segments parse `clean` (no DESYNC) — they are valid PM4 streams, not misparsed buffers.**
6. **One-shot `[segdump]` full packet walk of a content segment (desc#0, len 0xD38) — the decisive proof.** It is a complete, sensible draw:
   `SET_CONSTANT scissor → T0 reg=0x4000 cnt=1008 (ALU shader constants, v0=1.0f) → T0 reg=0x4400 cnt=1024 (more constants) → T0 reg=0x2200 cnt=12 (RB_DEPTHCONTROL/blend) → T0 reg=0x2180 cnt=5 (SQ_PROGRAM_CNTL=0x10010001, MATCHES piece-3a's kicked value) → T0 reg=0x2000 cnt=16 (RB_SURFACE_INFO) → T0 reg=0x2100 (PA_CL_VPORT) → T0 reg=0x4800 cnt=186 (FETCH constants = textures + vertex streams) → T0 reg=0xA31 (COHER_STATUS_HOST setup) → WAIT_REG_MEM (coherency wait) → DRAW_INDX`. Coherent state, not corruption; consistent frame-to-frame.

### Corrected census (measured, per full menu frame; trustworthy after fixing init-field [op-0x22 initiator is data[1]] + fetch-constant detection [type-0 reg 0x4800])
- **realDraws≈15, rectDraws≈21, texFetch(fetch-const loads)≈45, EDRAM resolve(RB_COPY)≈330, VIZ_QUERY≈40** — every frame, in the device+13568 directory segments, all parsing `clean`.
- So the title DOES build textured content draws with shaders, ~2000 ALU constants, 186 fetch constants (textures+vertex streams), viewport/blend/depth/surface state, EDRAM resolves, and occlusion (VIZ) queries. The earlier "only clears, 0 textures" was the parser.

### ⇒ The re-grounding (what's now TRUE vs what was an artifact)
- **TRUE (cont.10/c11, was RIGHT):** "the title builds a deferred render-program (device+13568 segments) but variant A NEVER EXECUTES it." The fence-forward stopgap fakes GPU completion of these segments *without executing them* → built content is never rendered, and the title moves on.
- **ARTIFACT (cont.10(c10)/c12/21/22):** "the segments contain 0 draws / only state" and therefore "content is not built anywhere" and therefore "the A↔B coupling needs a real GPU pixel result before the title will BUILD content." All downstream of the broken census parser. The producer/consumer dead-end and the "render the clears for a real result" plan were chasing a phantom.
- The night-log's own `sub_821C6E58` comment already named the clean fix: *"a continuous CP that follows the WAIT_REG_MEM-chained deferred IBs and executes them, so the fence advances as a real result… This forwarding MUST be replaced before a real renderer lands."* We now have PROOF the content to execute is there.

### NEXT — piece 3b, re-scoped: EXECUTE the deferred segments (not "render the clears")
Make variant A's CP execute the device+13568 directory segments each frame (the descriptor walk already exists in the census; resolve guest=0xA0000000|(addr&0x1FFFFFFF), run each via `ExecutePM4`), translating DRAW_INDX→vkCmdDraw with piece-1 (renderpass/pipeline) + piece-3a (draw-state) + the loaded ALU(0x4000)/fetch(0x4800) constants + shaders → present; and advance the completion fence as a REAL result of executing them (replacing fence-forward). **Open RE for execution order:** how prod links the directory segments to ring execution — INDIRECT_BUFFER from a kicked IB, the `0001057C 821CC7A0 <ctx>` callback record driving per-segment execution, or GPU auto-consume of the build cursor (device+13568..13572). Determine that (prod CP trace) so variant A executes them in the right order with the right state. Diagnostics added this session (all gated, default-safe, default boot unregressed): `REX_RESULTSCAN`, corrected `REX_CHUNKDUMP` census (correct walker + DESYNC flag + result-gate + `[segdump]`). Run-base unchanged.

### cont.22 /loop — piece-3b increment 1: content-draw PIPELINE STATE extracted (the menu HUD, fully characterized)
Extended the census walk with a frame-level register shadow (regs 0x2000-0x233F, updated as we walk segments in directory order — state carries across segments within a frame) and a per-draw `[drawstate]` dump. Pure read/track: NO execution, NO side effects (unlike running ExecutePM4 on the segments, which would fire interrupts/fences). This finally gives the CONTENT draws' state (piece-3a only ever saw the 3 kicked clears). Measured at the full-menu state:
- **~107 content draws/frame**, two dominant shaders + a rare third:
  - **prim=5 (tri-strip), numI=4** = a quad as a 2-tri strip — UI sprites/rectangles. `progCntl=0x10010001` (68/frame).
  - **prim=13 (0xD = quad list), numI=252** = 63 quads batched — text glyphs / HUD grids. `progCntl=0x10110101` (37/frame).
  - **prim=4 (tri-list), numI=0, progCntl=0x10002, mode=0x6** (2/frame) — a state/setup draw (numI=0).
- **All content draws share:** RT pitch=640, msaa=0, **fmt=0 (8_8_8_8 RGBA8)**, base=0x0 (EDRAM base 0); viewport 1280×-720 off(640,360) (Y-flipped full-screen); **blend0=0x7060706 = real ALPHA BLEND** (not the clears' One/Zero); colorCtl=0x8700000E; depthCtl=0x700736 (depth test on); **mode=0x4 (kColorDepth)** for the 105 UI draws (mode=0x6 for the 2 setup draws).
- **Scissor splits the frame into regions** — (0,0)-(640,368) and (640,360)-(1280,720) recur = the title renders the 1280×720 frame in **640×368 EDRAM tiles** (EDRAM is small; the 360 tiles large surfaces). So the RT "pitch=640 / base=0" + per-tile scissor = standard 360 EDRAM tiling; the Vulkan side will render to an offscreen RGBA8 target (Xenia-style) and treat the tiles as regions.
- ⇒ **The menu content is now fully characterized for translation:** alpha-composited 2D UI (quads + quad-list text) through 2 shaders to a tiled RGBA8 EDRAM surface with depth. Matches the loaded shader set (Simple/SPTextured/SpHud…) and the hand-ported SPIR-V in tools/shaderc/out (Simple/SimpleCol/SPTextured/SPUntextured.frag). Diagnostic added (gated under REX_CHUNKDUMP): `[drawstate]` content-draw state dump. Default boot unregressed.

### cont.22 /loop — piece-3b increment 2: content geometry decoded (auto-index, one shared vertex pool)
Extended the census shadow to also track the vertex/texture fetch constants (regs 0x4800-0x497F, via type-0 and SET_CONSTANT type-1) and added a per-draw `[drawgeo]` decode: source-select (VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR[7:6]), index buffer (for kDMA: data[2]=VGT_DMA_BASE, data[3]=VGT_DMA_SIZE.num_words; fmt = init[11]), and the bound vertex streams (fetch slots, type[1:0]==3=kVertex). Authoritative formats from rexglue `command_processor.cpp` (ExecutePacketType3Draw) + `registers.h` (VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR) + `xenos.h` (xe_gpu_vertex_fetch_t). Measured at the full-menu state:
- **All 97 content draws are `auto-index`** (source_select=2) — sequential vertices, **NO index buffer**. So prim=5/numI=4 = 4 sequential verts (a quad as tri-strip), prim=13/numI=252 = 252 sequential verts. ⇒ increment 3 needs no index-buffer handling — just `vkCmdDraw(numI)` per draw.
- **All draws share ONE vertex stream: fetch slot 1** (`vf1 @ ~0xA01FE0FC`, a ~10.5 MB pool — a per-frame dynamic vertex ring the title fills). The fetch constant is set once (persistent), the SAME address for ~90 draws ⇒ per-draw differentiation is NOT a different vertex buffer; it is a per-draw VERTEX OFFSET into the shared pool and/or per-draw ALU constants (reg 0x4000 uniforms — recall the segdump's reg0x4000 cnt=1008 + reg0x4400 cnt=1024 constant loads).
- ⇒ **The remaining unknown for pixel-correct rendering = the vertex FORMAT + per-draw offset mechanism**, which live in the **vertex shader microcode** (the vfetch instructions decode the pool bytes into position/UV/color, and the auto-index base/offset). That is the increment-3 RE frontier (translate or hand-RE the 2 dominant vertex shaders, progCntl 0x10010001 / 0x10110101). A simplified first render (unit-quad per draw using scissor + a flat color, ignoring the real vertex format) could validate the segment-exec→pipeline→present path end-to-end before the format is fully RE'd.
- **NEXT (increment 3):** (1) RE the vertex format of the 2 dominant shaders (prod-oracle trace of the vfetch, or read the microcode at the SQ_PROGRAM base); (2) wire segment execution into the CP/present path (decide: shadow-render each frame's directory segments with side-effects guarded, vs. the real fence-advancing CP); (3) build the VkPipeline (alpha blend `0x7060706`, depth `0x700736`, the 2 shaders) + upload the vertex pool + `vkCmdDraw` per content draw into an offscreen RGBA8 RT → present. Diagnostic added (gated under REX_CHUNKDUMP): `[drawgeo]`. Default boot unregressed (exit-124, 0 leak, 0 crash).

### cont.22 /loop — piece-3b increment 3 (RE start): vertex DATA located + screen coords confirmed; per-draw pool offset is the open question
Added a one-shot `[vtxdump]` (gated under REX_CHUNKDUMP): dumps ALL fetch slots (raw d0/d1 → type/byteaddr/words) for a content draw, then scans the candidate base translations for the first non-zero region and dumps it as hex+float. Measured at the full-menu state, prim-5 (quad, numI=4) draw:
- **Fetch slots:** slot 1 = the only real **kVertex** stream (type=3, byteaddr=0x1FE0FC, ~2.75M words = ~10.5 MB pool). slot 0 = type-0 (a huge "constant" stream, addr 0x2000000). slots 2/5/8/… = type-3 but addr/words=0 (unused). So **one vertex stream (slot 1)** + the constant streams.
- **Vertex data FOUND in the physical-window translation** `guest = 0xA0000000|(byteaddr&0x1FFFFFFF) = 0xA01FE0FC`: the pool head is zero, first non-zero at **+0x2A9F0**, and it contains **screen-coordinate floats — `441FE000`=639.5, `43B7C000`=367.5** (exactly the 640×368 EDRAM-tile extents) + `BF000000`=-0.5 half-texel offsets. So the geometry IS the menu UI, in screen space, at the physical-window address. (The non-physical base 0x1FE0FC held heap/string bytes — wrong translation.)
- **⚠ OPEN (the increment-3 blocker):** the draws are auto-index reading vertices [0,numI) from the fetch base, but the captured fetch base (0x1FE0FC) points at the ZERO pool head, while the real data is at +0x2A9F0. So each draw has a **per-draw vertex OFFSET into the shared pool** that is NOT in the fetch-constant base I capture — it's a vfetch immediate offset (in the VS microcode) or set via a constant-load packet (LOAD_ALU_CONSTANT 0x2F / IM-load) the census doesn't track. Also: the per-draw fetch base was mostly constant (0x1FE0FC) across 90 draws ⇒ the differentiation is the offset, not the base.
- **NEXT (resolve the offset — authoritative): prod-oracle vfetch trace.** Run prod under gdb at the menu, break in the GPU vertex-fetch path (or watch reads of the 0x…1FE0FC pool), capture the ACTUAL byte address each content draw reads → reveals stride + per-draw offset + attribute layout in one shot. Then write the generic VS (position from screen coords → clip, pass color/UV per the .updb interpolators) and proceed to the Vulkan build (segment exec → pipeline → vkCmdDraw → present). Diagnostic added (gated under REX_CHUNKDUMP): `[vtxdump]`. Default boot unregressed.

### cont.22 /loop — piece-3b increment 3: VERTEX FORMAT CRACKED (float2 screen-space position, 8-byte stride)
Two findings this iteration: (1) the `.xbv` vertex shaders are **big-endian D3D9 `vs_3_0` bytecode** (version token `FF FE 03 00` at file offset 0xb4, BE) with a constant table declaring **`$worldviewProj`** (a 4×4 matrix uniform) — so buffer positions are in a UI/authoring space and the VS transforms them by a matrix in the ALU constants (reg 0x4000, the segdump's cnt=1008 load). (2) Refined `[vtxdump]` to find a DENSE screen-coord region in the pool and dump its repeating structure. Result @ `0xA01FE0FC + 0x31E74` — consecutive 8-byte pairs form **coherent screen-space quads**:
```
(0,0) (1768,0) (1768,1043) (0,1043)            ← a quad (UI canvas / backdrop)
(348,261) (932,261) (932,459) (348,459)        ← a UI panel rectangle
```
⇒ **The vertex format is float2 (x,y) position, 8-byte stride** (consecutive 8-byte reads form clean rectangle corners — a 12/16-byte stride or an (x,y,u,v) layout does NOT — the UV/Z values would be out of range). So the prim-13 quad-list draws are **position-only** vertices; **color + UV are per-draw ALU constants** (reg 0x4000), not per-vertex (consistent with the Simple PS = texture*color where color is a constant and the texcoord is computed/constant). Coordinates exceed 1280×720 (e.g. 1768×1043) ⇒ a UI authoring resolution mapped to the screen by `$worldviewProj`.
- ⇒ **This is the increment-3 unblocker.** Enough to attempt a FIRST render of the menu layout: VkPipeline with a float2-position vertex input + a generic VS applying `$worldviewProj` (read the matrix from reg 0x4000 ALU constants) + a flat-color/textured FS (the hand-ported SPIR-V) → `vkCmdDraw` the pool quads into an offscreen RGBA8 RT → present. (The per-draw pool OFFSET still needs pinning for correctness — but a first pass can render the dense regions to validate the path.)
- **NEXT (the BUILD — increment 3 proper):** wire segment execution into the CP/present path (shadow-render the directory segments each frame, side-effects [INTERRUPT/EVENT_WRITE/XE_SWAP] guarded) + build the float2 VkPipeline + read `$worldviewProj` from reg 0x4000 + upload the vertex pool + `vkCmdDraw` per content draw → offscreen RGBA8 → present. Iterate the per-draw offset + color/UV constants until the menu renders. Default boot unregressed.

### cont.22 /loop — piece-3b increment 3, Layer 1: the menu-quad VkPipeline (float2 + mvp/color) WORKS ✅
Built + validated the format-independent rendering plumbing — the float2 menu-quad pipeline the real geometry plugs into:
- **Shaders (tools/shaderc/ported/):** `menuquad.vert` (float2 `inPos` → `mvp * (pos,0,1)`, push-const `{mat4 mvp, vec4 color}`) + `menuquad.frag` (flat `color`). Compiled via shadercc → SPIR-V, embedded as `runtime/menu_shaders.h`.
- **Pipeline (vulkan_render.cpp, gated `REX_MENUTEST`):** float2 vertex input (binding 0, stride 8, R32G32_SFLOAT) + an 80-byte push constant + **alpha blend (SRC_ALPHA / ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA — the title's UI compositing)** + TRIANGLE_LIST + dynamic viewport/scissor, reusing the piece-1 render pass. A host-visible persistently-mapped vertex buffer (`EnsureMenuVB`, grows on demand). The `REX_MENUTEST` PresentOnce path uploads 3 hardcoded clip-space rects (6 verts each) and draws them with 3 colors + identity MVP → present + capture.
- **VERIFIED:** `REX_RENDER=1 REX_MENUTEST=1 REX_RENDER_SHOT=10 REX_FAIRSCHED=1` → 2100+ frames, 0 Vulkan errors/crashes; captured /tmp/varianta_menu.ppm = 3 overlapping rects with **correct alpha-blend colors in the overlaps** (8 distinct colors: bg + 3 rects + 4 blends). Proves float2 input + push constants + alpha blend + multi-draw end-to-end. **Default boot UNREGRESSED** (all gated behind REX_MENUTEST/REX_RENDER).
- **NEXT (Layer 2 — feed real geometry):** extract the menu quads from the pool in the census (positions float2) + read the `$worldviewProj` matrix from reg 0x4000 ALU constants → upload to g_menuVB → set the push-constant MVP → draw the real menu geometry (resolve the per-draw pool offset; start by rendering the dense regions). Then per-draw color/UV + the hand-ported FS for textured elements.

### cont.22 /loop — piece-3b increment 3, Layer 2: census→render BRIDGE works (real pool geometry rendered); correctness needs the per-draw vertex mapping
Built the Layer-2 infrastructure + an approximate extraction:
- **Bridge (`rex_render::SubmitMenuGeometry(clipXY, vertCount)`):** the CP hands clip-space geometry to the render thread (mutex-guarded buffer). PresentOnce draws submitted geometry (flat color) when present, else the REX_MENUTEST hardcoded rects. Capture now triggers on the FIRST frame with real geometry (the render-thread frame counter is decoupled from guest progress, so a fixed REX_RENDER_SHOT frame fired ~10s before the menu loaded ~30s).
- **Extraction (census, gated REX_CHUNKDUMP, only when rex_render::Enabled):** capture the content draws' kVertex pool base during the segment walk (`menuPoolBase`, from the [drawgeo] decode — NOT the post-walk `fetch[2]`, which is stale), find the pool's dense screen-coord region, collect a contiguous run of screen-range float2 verts, treat as quad-list (groups of 4 → 2 tris), auto-fit the bbox → clip.
- **RESULT (REX_RENDER=1 REX_MENUTEST=1 REX_CHUNKDUMP=3 + the full-menu envs):** `[menugeo] pool=0xA01FE0FC dense=+0x31E6C collected 468 verts -> 234 tris bbox=(0,0)-(1768,1043)` → submitted (702 verts) → captured. **The bridge works end-to-end** — the title's REAL pool geometry flows CP→render thread→GPU→present (the big filled region IS the (0,0)-(1768,1043) backdrop quad, correctly auto-fit). **BUT the render is a garbled triangle soup, not recognizable UI:** the contiguous-collect + assume-quad-list grouping is wrong — the verts must be carved per-draw (each draw's offset + numI + prim) to triangulate correctly. Default boot UNREGRESSED.
- **⇒ The remaining blocker for CORRECT rendering = the per-draw vertex MAPPING** (which pool offset + how many verts + which prim each draw consumes). I HAVE per-draw numI + prim (from the draw decode); the MISSING piece is the per-draw start OFFSET. The contradiction stands: fetch base is constant (0x1FE0FC, the zero pool head) across 90 draws + auto-index reads [0,numI) + yet the data is at +0x2A9F0/+0x31E6C and draws render distinct content. This can only be resolved by understanding the **vfetch addressing in the VS microcode** (the `.xbv` Xenos vertex shader — its vfetch instruction's stride/offset) OR a **prod-oracle trace** of the actual per-draw vertex read addresses. **NEXT:** resolve that (VS vfetch disasm or prod trace) → carve the pool per-draw → correct geometry; OR test the sequential-consumption hypothesis (draws consume the pool in order: draw N's verts follow draw N-1's, carved by numI+prim).

### cont.22 /loop — piece-3b: opcode HISTOGRAM ([ophist]) — full PM4 usage revealed; microcode is in-stream + rendering is TILED
Added a type-3 opcode histogram to the census (gated REX_CHUNKDUMP) to find any constant-load packet the shadow misses. Per menu frame (two consecutive census frames shown):
- `DRAW(0x22)=15  DRAW2(0x36)=20  SETCONST(0x2D)=90  WAITREG(0x3C)=52  EVTWRITE(0x46)=41  EVENT_WRITE_SHD(0x58)=6  EVENT_WRITE_EXT(0x5A)=15  INT(0x54)=5  INVALIDATE_STATE(0x3B)=23`
- **`IM_LOAD(0x27)=20  IM_LOAD_IMM(0x2B)=20`** ⇒ **the VS+PS microcode is EMBEDDED in the command stream** (IM_LOAD_IMMEDIATE carries the instructions). So the **VS vfetch (the authoritative vertex stride/offset/format) is extractable directly from the segments — no `.xbv` parse needed.** This is the clean unblocker for the per-draw vertex mapping.
- **`LOAD_ALU(0x2F)=5`** (first: d0=0x2965000 d1=0x3F0 d2=0x10 cnt=3) — only 5/frame, NOT per-draw ⇒ constants are NOT DMA'd per-draw via 0x2F; my "constant fetch base" finding stands (the per-draw differentiation is the vfetch offset / worldviewProj, not a per-draw constant load).
- **`0x60=176  0x61=45  0x35(DRAW_INDX_2_BIN)=1`** ⇒ heavy **EDRAM tiling/binning** (SET_BIN_MASK/SELECT): the title issues draws PER-TILE with bin masks (the 640×368 EDRAM tiles). So correct rendering must model the binning/tiling, not just translate draws.
- **⇒ Two sharpened next steps:** (1) extract + disasm the VS microcode from an IM_LOAD_IMMEDIATE (0x2B) packet → its vfetch instruction (ucode.h `VertexFetchInstruction`: stride[8b], offset[23b], format) → the exact per-draw vertex addressing + layout → carve the pool correctly. (2) Model the tile binning (0x60/0x61 bin mask/select + DRAW_INDX_2_BIN) for correct per-tile rendering. Both are real Xenos-GPU-subsystem work; (1) unblocks correct geometry, (2) unblocks correct tiling. Diagnostic added (gated REX_CHUNKDUMP): `[ophist]`. Default boot unregressed.

### cont.22 /loop — piece-3b: VS vfetch DECODED ([vfetch]) — format authoritative; per-draw differentiation is $worldviewProj (not a per-draw base)
Added a `[vfetch]` scanner: for each VS IM_LOAD_IMMEDIATE (0x2B; dword0=shader_type 0=VS, dword1&0xFFFF=size_dwords, microcode follows), scan the microcode in 3-dword windows for vfetch instructions (d0[4:0]=opcode kVertexFetch=0 + d0[19]=must_be_one; d1[21:16]=VertexFormat; d2[7:0]=dword stride, d2[30:8]=signed dword offset; fetch_const_index = d0[24:20]*3 + d0[26:25]). Measured (all 8 menu VS shaders, size=15 dw, IDENTICAL):
- **`vfetch slot=0 fmt=float2 stride=2dw off=0dw dst=r0`** (raw d0=0x00080000 d1=0x00253B48 d2=0x00000002; format 0x25=37=k_32_32_FLOAT=float2). **AUTHORITATIVE: the vertex format is float2 (x,y) position, 8-byte stride, offset 0, single attribute, from fetch SLOT 0.** Confirms the data-RE'd format AND corrects the slot (the vfetch source is slot 0, not the slot-1 the type==3 scan flagged).
- **Per-draw slot-0 probe ([drawgeo] SLOT0=…):** slot 0 = **constant `0xA2000000` across ALL draws** (type 0/2, NOT 3=kVertex), head v0=(0,0). So slot 0 is NOT a per-draw-varying base. Combined with off=0 + auto-index reads [0,numI), **all draws read the SAME shared vertex set at slot 0; the per-draw differentiation must be the `$worldviewProj` matrix** (a shared template positioned per draw). ⇒ REFUTES the "per-draw fetch base / sequential carve" hypotheses. The screen-coord rectangles found earlier were at slot 1 (0x1FE0FC) — a DIFFERENT region, not the vfetch source.
- **⇒ Refined model:** shared vertex template at slot 0 (0xA2000000), float2, + a **per-draw `$worldviewProj` matrix** (in the ALU constants, reg 0x4000) that positions it. For correct rendering: read the verts from 0xA2000000 (numI per draw, float2) + read the per-draw 4×4 matrix from reg 0x4000 + transform on the GPU (push-const MVP) → vkCmdDraw. **NEXT:** (1) dump slot-0's (0xA2000000) actual vertex data (head is (0,0) — check deeper / the full numI verts per draw); (2) locate `$worldviewProj` in the reg-0x4000 ALU constants (the .xbv constant table gives its c-register index) + read it per draw; (3) render per-draw with the real MVP. ⚠ This vertex-addressing layer is intricate (the contradiction of constant base + off 0 + distinct content took several probes); the AUTHORITATIVE fallback if the model doesn't render is a **prod-oracle trace** of the actual per-draw vertex read addresses. The renderer remains a large multi-iteration Xenos-GPU build; infra (pipeline+bridge) + format are in place. Diagnostic added (gated REX_CHUNKDUMP): `[vfetch]` + `[drawgeo] SLOT0`. Default boot unregressed.

### cont.22 /loop — piece-3b: ⚠ the vfetch source (slot 0) is UNINITIALIZED (0x0BADF00D poison) at census time — the vertex DATA isn't present where/when expected
Dumped slot-0's actual data (0xA2000000, the real vfetch source): head is zeros, **first non-zero @+0xFFFC = `0x0BADF00D`** (a classic allocator POISON sentinel), 191911 scattered non-zero dwords but NO dense screen-coord region. `0x0BADF00D` is NOT in variant A's runtime (grep clean) ⇒ it's the **guest/title's own allocator poison**. So the title allocated the slot-0 vertex pool but, **at the only time variant A can read it (a swap boundary, when the census fires), it is still POISON — not real vertex data.** The screen-coord rectangles found earlier were in slot 1 (0x1FE0FC) = a DIFFERENT buffer, NOT the vfetch source (likely stale/leftover real data from a prior use).
- **⇒ Two interpretations, indistinguishable from variant A alone:** (a) the title's **vertex-generation never ran** in variant A (a deeper execution gap — the UI code that computes+writes vertices into the pool didn't execute / is gated on the same async-completion the renderer needs); (b) **timing/lifecycle** — the pool is filled→drawn→recycled (re-poisoned) WITHIN a frame, so it's poison again by the swap-boundary census. Either way, **the verts are not readable at any point variant A's census can sample**, so the "carve the pool + render" approach CANNOT work from variant A's CP at swap time.
- **⇒ This REDIRECTS the renderer:** the blocker is NOT draw translation (infra is built: pipeline + bridge + format decoded) — it's that **the vertex DATA the draws reference is poison/unwritten at the readable time.** Correct rendering needs the verts to exist when read, which is a vertex-data-lifecycle / execution-path question, not a translation one.
- **NEXT = PROD-ORACLE comparison (authoritative, the right tool now):** run prod (`out/build/linux-amd64-release/south_park_td`, base 0x100000000, symbols, `handle SIGSEGV nostop pass`) at the menu; read its fetch-constant slot-0 base + the vertex data there AT A DRAW (break in the rexglue CP draw path / IssueDraw, or watch the pool). Prod renders the menu, so prod's pool HAS real verts — at what address + what time (relative to the draw)? That resolves (a) vs (b): if prod's slot-0 also points at a pool that's only valid mid-frame, it's timing (variant A's CP must consume synchronously with the title's fill); if prod's verts are at a stable address variant A's is poison at, the vertex-gen path differs. ⚠⚠ The renderer is the full Xenos vertex-fetch/lifecycle + tiled-raster + shader/texture subsystem — a LARGE multi-session build, and the vertex-DATA-availability (this finding) is a fundamental gap beyond the (built) translation infra. Diagnostic added (gated REX_CHUNKDUMP): `[vtxdump] SLOT0` scan. Default boot unregressed.

### cont.22 /loop — prod-oracle attempt hit OPTIMIZED-BUILD gdb friction (deferred); renderer CONSOLIDATION + the clear faithful-CP path
Wrote `tools/prod_vfetch.gdb` (break at `ExecutePacketType3Draw`, filter to menu content shaders progc 0x10010001/0x10110101, read register-file slot-0 fetch constant + dump verts). **Hit a wall: prod is an OPTIMIZED RelWithDebInfo build** — gdb cannot resolve `this` nor the `rex::graphics::CommandProcessor*` cast at the breakpoint (`No symbol this/rex in current context`), and a static `ptype`/offset query returned `No symbol table` (lazy/split debug info). The breakpoint DID fire (prod executes draws), but the typed register read failed. **Finishing it needs raw member-offset access from $rdi OR a debug prod build — deferred to a focused session.** Tool committed as a scaffold with the limitation documented.
- **⇒ CONSOLIDATION (renderer state after this session's arc):**
  - ✅ **Breakthrough:** content IS built (the "no content" verdict was a census-parser artifact — 1024-dw truncation + type-0/1 misalignment). Title builds full menu content (draws + state + shaders + resolves + occlusion queries) into the device+13568 deferred segments every frame.
  - ✅ **Infra built + verified:** menu-quad VkPipeline (float2 + mvp/color push-const + alpha blend, REX_MENUTEST — 3 rects rendered) + census→render bridge (`SubmitMenuGeometry`, real pool geometry flows CP→GPU→present) + full PM4/opcode characterization.
  - ✅ **Vertex format decoded** from the in-stream VS microcode (IM_LOAD_IMMEDIATE): float2 (x,y), 8-byte stride, off 0, fetch slot 0.
  - ⛔ **The remaining blocker (this finding):** the vfetch source (slot 0, 0xA2000000) is 0x0BADF00D **poison at swap-time** — the only time variant A's census can sample it. Verts are valid only WHEN the title's render path consumes the segments (mid-frame), which the swap-boundary census never reaches.
- **⇒ THE CLEAR PATH = a FAITHFUL CONTINUOUS CP** (the large multi-session build): variant A must execute the deferred device+13568 segments **when the title flushes/kicks them (mid-frame, vertex pool fresh)** — NOT at the swap census. Concrete first step: hook the title's flush/kick (`sub_821C6D58` / `sub_821C6C80` / `sub_821C6600`), run the just-built segments through `ExecutePM4` there (pool valid), translate DRAW_INDX→vkCmdDraw (built pipeline), read verts (now real). Then tile binning (0x60/0x61), per-draw $worldviewProj (reg 0x4000), textures + hand-ported FS. ⚠ This is a SUSTAINED ARCHITECTURAL build (full Xenos vertex-fetch/raster subsystem), not incremental /loop probing — the infra + format + understanding are all in place for it. Prod-oracle (raw-offset rewrite of prod_vfetch.gdb) is the authoritative capstone for a future focused session. Default boot unregressed.

### cont.22 /loop — ⛔ DECISIVE (REX_POOLCHK + 40-VS vfetch survey): the content vfetch source (slot 0) is NEVER written with verts in variant A — a vertex-DATA-availability gap, not timing/translation
The flush-hook test, run as `REX_POOLCHK` (sample the pool at the kick-gate sub_821C6C80, ~1410×/frame = dense mid-frame) + a 40-shader vfetch survey:
- **All 40 menu VS shaders fetch slot 0** (float2 / stride 2dw / off 0) — IDENTICAL, uniform. So the content draws unambiguously fetch fetch-constant **slot 0 = 0xA2000000**.
- **slot 0 (0xA2000000) is NEVER real verts:** maxRealFloats/64 = **0–1** across **120k+ mid-frame samples** (head = `0xFFFFFFFF` filler; the swap census saw `0x0BADF00D`/zeros). So it's NOT a timing/lifecycle issue (the verts are never written, mid-frame OR at swap).
- **slot 1 (0x1FE0FC) is a RED HERRING:** NO VS fetches it (0/40), and its head is zeros (the screen-coord rects found earlier were deep in its region but it is NOT the vfetch source). So the slot-1 "screen coords" are not the menu content geometry.
- **⇒ DECISIVE: the menu content draws fetch from an EMPTY pool (slot 0) in variant A.** The title's vertex-GENERATION does not produce data at 0xA2000000. This is a **vertex-data-availability gap**, upstream of both translation (infra built) AND the faithful-CP timing idea (a faithful CP can't read verts that are never written). ⚠ This SUPERSEDES the "faithful CP fixes it" framing: a continuous CP is necessary but NOT sufficient — the verts must first EXIST at slot 0.
- **WHY slot 0 is empty (the open root, needs the prod-oracle):** either (i) variant A's fetch-constant value (0x02000000) is wrong vs what the title set (a CP/SET_CONSTANT capture gap), (ii) the title writes the verts to a different address than the fetch constant points to (a variant-A memory/addressing bug), or (iii) the vertex-gen is gated on an unmet condition (the same async-completion gaps). **Only the prod-oracle resolves it**: prod renders the menu, so prod's slot-0 fetch constant + the memory it points to HAVE real verts — comparing prod's slot-0 value + vertex address with variant A's (0xA2000000=empty) pinpoints the divergence. Prod-oracle is DEFERRED (optimized-build gdb friction — needs raw $rdi member offsets or a debug prod build; tools/prod_vfetch.gdb scaffold ready).
- **⇒ Renderer state (decisive endpoint of variant-A probing):** content built ✅, infra built ✅ (pipeline + bridge), format decoded ✅, but the content vfetch source is empty in variant A ⛔ → the menu cannot render until the vertex data exists at slot 0. The remaining work (find/fix why slot 0 is empty → then faithful CP → tiling → textures) is a sustained multi-session GPU build whose FIRST blocker (vertex data) requires the prod-oracle. Diagnostic added (gated): `REX_POOLCHK`. Default boot unregressed.

### cont.22 /loop — prod-oracle BLOCKED (prod has NO DWARF); redirect to a variant-A HW-watchpoint for the vertex-gen writer
Tried to finish the prod-oracle via raw offsets. **Blocker found: the prod binary has ZERO `.debug_*` (DWARF) sections** (`readelf -S` — only `.symtab` function names that let breakpoints resolve). So gdb has NO type info — `this`, the `CommandProcessor*` cast, `ptype`, and `pahole` ALL fail. The gdb-prod-oracle (read prod's register file) is **not viable on this binary** without (a) a debug prod rebuild (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`) or (b) source-computed raw member offsets (error-prone: base classes/vtable/padding). Tool note updated in `tools/prod_vfetch.gdb`.
- **Refined understanding of the gap (no prod needed):** the content draws fetch slot 0 (0xA2000000, EMPTY across 120k+ samples) while real screen-coord verts sit in slot 1 (0x1FE0FC). The content draw's OWN segment SET_CONSTANT (FETCH) sets slot 0 = 0x02000000 (→ the empty 0xA2000000) AND slot 1 = 0x001FE0FF (→ the verts). The 40 menu VS all vfetch slot 0. ⇒ **The title intends the verts at slot-0's target (0xA2000000) but variant A never writes them there; slot 1 holds a different/other buffer.** This is a vertex-DATA-placement gap (the vertex-gen doesn't produce data at 0xA2000000 in variant A).
- **NEXT (tractable, NO prod): a VARIANT-A hardware watchpoint.** variant A is NOT stripped, so a HW watchpoint on the vertex region + `bt` gives the recompiled `sub_XXXXXXXX` writer. Watch (i) g_base+0xA2000000 (slot-0 target — does ANYTHING but the allocator poison write it?) and (ii) g_base+0xA01FE0FC+0x31E6C (slot-1, where verts ARE written — find the vertex-gen function). Comparing the two writers + why slot-0's target stays empty pins the gap. gdb: break after g_base init (e.g. at VdSwap), `p g_base`, `watch *(int*)(g_base+ADDR)`, `bt` on hit. Then either fix the vertex-gen placement OR (if it's a deeper title-state gap) accept the renderer needs the full faithful-CP/vertex-lifecycle build. ⚠ The renderer remains a large multi-session build; the major value (breakthrough + characterization + infra) is delivered, and this pins the precise remaining root.

### cont.22 /loop — ⛔ HW-WATCHPOINT CONFIRMED: the content vfetch source (slot 0) is NEVER written; a writer (sub_8242BF10) targets slot 1 instead — a vertex-data ADDRESS MISMATCH
Variant A is NOT stripped, so a HW write-watch + `bt` names the recompiled writer (`tools/poolwatch.gdb`: at the first __imp__VdSwap, read g_base, `gdb.WP_WRITE` watchpoints on the pools, `bt` on hit, keep running). Watched BOTH slot-0 target (g_base+0xA2000000, the content vfetch source) and the slot-1 region (g_base+0xA01FE0FC+0x31E6C, where real screen-coord verts appeared). Full menu run (REX_NOTOKEN+CSLEAK+CPCOMPLETE+MOVIE_EOF, ran to exit):
- **slot 0 (0xA2000000) = ZERO writes** the entire run ⇒ the content draws' vfetch source is NEVER written (its head stays 0xFFFFFFFF set before VdSwap#1). The content draws read UNINITIALIZED data. **HW-confirmed — the strongest evidence yet.**
- **slot 1 (0x1FE0FC+0x31E6C) = written by `sub_8242BF10`** (ppc_recomp.60.cpp:13194 = guest 0x8242BF10). So a recompiled guest fn DOES write real verts — to the SLOT-1 region — but the content draws vfetch SLOT 0 (which it never writes).
- **⇒ DECISIVE ROOT = a vertex-data ADDRESS MISMATCH:** verts are written to slot 1's buffer (by sub_8242BF10) while the content draws fetch slot 0 (unwritten). Either (a) sub_8242BF10 IS the content vertex-gen but writes to the wrong address vs the fetch constant (slot 0 target = 0xA2000000), OR (b) sub_8242BF10 writes a non-content (setup/clear) buffer and the content vertex-gen (→ slot 0) never runs. Distinguishing needs: identify sub_8242BF10 (guest 0x8242BF10 — what it is + whether its dest is the content pool) + why slot-0's target (0xA2000000) is never written.
- **⇒ Renderer state (HW-confirmed endpoint of variant-A probing):** content built ✅, infra built ✅ (pipeline + bridge), format decoded ✅, but the content draws' vfetch source (slot 0) is NEVER written in variant A ⛔ → the menu cannot render. The remaining work — resolve the address mismatch (why slot-0's target stays empty / what sub_8242BF10's dest should be) then the full faithful-CP + vertex-lifecycle + tiling + textures build — is a SUSTAINED multi-session effort. The major value (the breakthrough + full characterization + Vulkan infra) is delivered. **Concrete lead for the next session: investigate sub_8242BF10 (guest 0x8242BF10) — the slot-1 vertex writer — vs the content draws' slot-0 fetch.** New tool: tools/poolwatch.gdb. Default boot unregressed (no code change — gdb tooling only).

### cont.22 /loop — ⭐ UNIFICATION + CORRECTION: the vertex-pool write traces to the RESOURCE-LOADER / TRANSITION chain (sub_8211B740); the renderer's vertex-data gap = the cont.22 async-completion root
Re-ran poolwatch with guest-context reads (variant A is -O0, so ctx.r3/r4 + the host bt are readable). The slot-region write fired with **ctx.r3=0xA1FFFFFC** (dest), and sub_8242BF10's body has `stw r0,4(r3)` ⇒ it writes 0xA1FFFFFC+4 = **0xA2000000** (slot-0's target!). The full caller chain:
```
sub_82250420 → sub_8211B740 → sub_8211BE68 → sub_822487C8 → sub_82448158 → sub_8244FE80 → sub_8242BF10 (memcpy, ppc_recomp.60:13194)
```
**`sub_8211B740` + `sub_82250420` are the cont.7/10/22 INTRO→MENU transition / resource-loader worker** (sub_82250420→sub_8211B740→sub_8210AF90 sets the transitions-flag; sub_8211B740 was traced in loop-iters 3-5 as the resource/async-task manager). So the vertex-pool population is DONE BY the resource-loader/transition chain via a generic memcpy (sub_8242BF10 = load-r4/store-r3/+16/dcbt block copy).
- **⚠ CORRECTION of "slot 0 NEVER written":** the 1st poolwatch run (watching only 0xA2000000's HEAD dword) saw 0 writes — but the memcpy writes 0xA2000000 via `stw r0,4(r3)` (r3=0xA1FFFFFC), and only **ONCE per run** (nondeterministic timing; the head-only watch missed it). So slot 0 IS written by the loader, but **only once / not fully populated** (poolchk head stays 0xFFFFFFFF) — because the loader (sub_8211B740, the cont.22-GATED transition chain) does NOT fully complete.
- **⇒ UNIFICATION:** the renderer's vertex-data gap and the cont.22 intro→menu TRANSITION block are **the SAME root** — the resource-loader / async-task manager (sub_8211B740) that cont.22 loop-iters 5-8 + piece-4 found is gated on real async/GPU completion. It populates the vertex pool (0xA2000000) but stalls before fully doing so ⇒ the content draws read a mostly-unpopulated pool. MOVIE_EOF drained the loader enough to load SHADERS (the breakthrough), but NOT enough to fully populate the VERTS.
- **⇒ The path is now unified + clear:** the renderer does NOT need a separate vertex-addressing fix — it needs the **resource-loader / async-task manager (sub_8211B740) to COMPLETE** (the cont.22 RENDERER-DESIGN faithful async/GPU-completion model). Completing it populates the vertex pool AND unblocks the transition AND lets the content draws render. The faithful-CP + this resource-loader-completion are the one big multi-session build. **NEXT:** trace WHY sub_8211B740's loader stalls mid-populate at the full-menu state (the per-child completion poll *(child+208) / the sub_8224F918 queue from piece-4, now with the vertex-copy context) — what async result it waits on to continue copying verts. New evidence: tools/poolwatch.gdb (the loader→memcpy chain). Default boot unregressed (gdb tooling only).

### cont.22 /loop — heuristic rendering EXHAUSTED; debug-prod-build ruled out; renderer's sole path = the big faithful-completion build (pausing /loop)
Improved the menu-geometry viz (per-quad cycling colors, 6-vert chunks) to make individual UI rects distinguishable. Result (/tmp/varianta_menu.png): STILL a triangle soup (large overlapping tris + slivers), NOT coherent UI rectangles — even with the correct float2 format. ⇒ **heuristic extraction/grouping of the slot-1 verts CANNOT reconstruct the menu** (no per-draw boundaries; the verts aren't a clean quad array at the read offset). Heuristics are exhausted.
- **Debug-prod-build (to unblock the prod-oracle) assessed + RULED OUT for now:** the prod build (out/build/linux-amd64-release) is Release (-O3 -DNDEBUG, no DWARF — confirmed); `command_processor.cpp` is NOT a TU there (it's in the separate rexglue-sdk static lib), so getting DWARF means rebuilding the rexglue-sdk graphics lib with -g + relinking prod — a big build that also touches the prod guardrail, for merely confirmatory value (it would confirm prod's loader populates slot 0). Not worth it as a /loop step.
- **⇒ EXHAUSTIVELY CONFIRMED: the renderer's sole forward path is the large multi-session FAITHFUL-COMPLETION build** (model the GPU resource-creation/async completion so sub_8211B740's loader fully runs AND the per-frame vertex-fill writes real verts to slot 0 = 0xA2000000, which the content draws vfetch). Every quick win is exhausted: force-past fails (loop-iter 6), heuristic render fails (soup), the prod-oracle is blocked (no DWARF), the verts never reach the content fetch source (HW-confirmed). Note: the vertex-FILL (per-frame UI render → slot 0) is distinct from the resource-loader's CLEAR of slot 0 (the memcpy caught earlier copied filler); both are part of the same gated render path.
- **⏸ PAUSING the autonomous /loop** at this point: the renderer is exhaustively characterized + the major value (the breakthrough that content IS built + full PM4/vertex characterization + working Vulkan pipeline & CP→GPU bridge + the unified root, 16 commits this session) is DELIVERED, and the sole remaining work is a deliberate multi-session architectural build that is a poor fit for 4-min /loop probes. **Decision needed from the user: (1) commit to the faithful-completion build as a focused effort, (2) accept a debug-prod-build to unblock the oracle for an authoritative cross-check first, or (3) redirect.** All findings/tools/diags are in this NIGHT-LOG + sp-varianta-bootstrap memory + NEXT-SESSION-PROMPT.

### cont.22 /loop — ⭐⭐ BREAKTHROUGH: the "vertex-data gap" WALL is OVERTURNED — the content verts EXIST and are reachable (`REX_EXECSEGS` executes the deferred segments → the LIVE fetch slot-0 is a type-3 kVertex pool of REAL screen-space verts)
User said "продолжай работу автономно" again after the pause. Re-grounded, then built **`REX_EXECSEGS`** (kernel.cpp, gated, default boot UNREGRESSED — verified exit 124 / 0 crashes / 191k progress lines): at each VdSwap, enumerate the `device+13568` DIRECTORY with the census's authoritative parse (top byte `0x81` = descriptor, low 24b = seg length dwords; next dword = phys), resolve `guest=0xA0000000|(phys&0x1FFFFFFF)`, and **`ExecutePM4` each segment** — i.e. actually EXECUTE the deferred content the census proved is built but never kicked. Distinct from `REX_CHUNKCP` (runs the directory as inline PM4 — wrong) and `REX_SEGCP` (scans the r3 staging range). Measured (run-base `REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30 REX_EXECSEGS=3`):
- **It executes cleanly:** 3 segments/frame, ~7–8 DRAW_INDX/frame (drawTotal 34→490 over 60 frames), no execsegs-induced crash (the ~45–50s SIGSEGV hits the BASELINE too — pre-existing, beyond the characterized-stable 30s window, NOT a regression).
- **First (negative) result:** the static `0xA2000000` (what every prior probe fixated on) stays `0x00000000` / 0 real floats across all 60 frames even WITH execution. So "execute the content → 0xA2000000 fills" is **refuted** — `0xA2000000` is simply NOT the content verts' home.
- **⭐ Then the LIVE fetch read flipped it:** read the ACTUAL fetch slot-0 constant the executed draws set (reg file `0x7FC80000+0x4800*4`) instead of the hardcoded `0xA2000000`. It is **`fc0=0x001A875B` → type 3 = kVertex → guest `0xA01A8758`, with 46/64 plausible floats**, and the address ADVANCES ~0x88000/frame (`0xA01A8758→0xA0230FF8→0xA02B9878→0xA03420F8→0xA03CA978→0xA04531F8`) = a per-frame growing pool.
- **⭐ RAW dump = DEFINITIVE structured verts** (6/6 frames identical): `640 360 | 1280 360 | 1280 720 | 0 0 …` — screen-space float2 pairs for the **1280×720** framebuffer (a screen-covering triangle). Matches the RE'd vfetch format EXACTLY (float2, stride 2dw, slot 0). NOT a filter coincidence (the first 6 floats are clean screen coords; weak `[-4096,4096]` filter irrelevant given the structure).
- **⇒ RECONCILIATION (rigorous, resolves the contradiction with cont.22's HW-watchpoint/POOLCHK "slot 0 never written"):** the **3 KICKED clears** set fetch slot 0 = `0x02000000`→`0xA2000000` (an empty setup pool) — that value is ALL the prior probes (REX_POOLCHK, the 40-VS survey, poolwatch, the swap-census) ever saw, because **the content segments never executed**. The **CONTENT draws** (deferred, never kicked) set fetch slot 0 to the real per-frame type-3 kVertex pool. Executing the segments (`REX_EXECSEGS`) is what reveals it. So the "vertex-data gap / 0xA2000000 empty / verts never written" verdict of the last ~6 continuations was a **measurement artifact of reading the fetch constant at the wrong time** (global reg file at swap/kick, holding the clears' stale value). **The verts were always there in the content draws' own state.**
- **⇒ The renderer is NO LONGER blocked on "verts don't exist."** The path is now concrete and unblocked: T2a (execute the segments) ✅ done + verified; **T2b (NEXT) = wire `DRAW_INDX`→`vkCmdDraw`:** in ExecutePM4's DRAW_INDX handler, under the render mode, read THIS draw's live fetch slot-0 (type-3 kVertex base + the `d1` size) + numI + piece-3a draw-state (RT/vp/scissor/blend/shader) → upload the float2 verts → vkCmdDraw into the Vulkan RT (the menu-quad pipeline already accepts float2) → present. Note DRAW_INDX is still a no-op count here; T2b makes it draw. ⚠ Verified the LAST draw/frame has real verts (consistent 6/6); T2b's per-draw capture will confirm all ~7–8 draws/frame and carve each draw's vert run (numI, prim). New diagnostic (gated, default-safe): `REX_EXECSEGS=N`. Commit this increment as `superheher` (not pushed).

### cont.22 /loop — T2b-step-1: per-draw fetch capture ([esdraw]) RESOLVES the open sub-question + pins the exact vkCmdDraw data
Added `[esdraw]` (gated, fires only while REX_EXECSEGS executes a segment, via `thread_local tl_execsegs`): captures EACH executed draw's live fetch slot-0 + numI + prim + first verts. The executed segments issue a FIXED 8-draw pattern per frame:
- **#0–3 = DEGENERATE setup draws** (numI=0, prim=0): fetch slot-0 = `0x02000000` (type 0) / `0x05004802` (type 2) → base `0xA2000000` (the empty pool). NO geometry.
- **#4–7 = REAL content rects** (numI=3, prim=8 = **kRectangleList**): fetch slot-0 = **type 3 (kVertex)**, base `0xA01A8730` advancing **+0x18/draw** (= 3 float2 verts, `words=6` each), v0/v1 = real screen coords with −0.5 half-texel offsets, **tiling the 1280×720 screen into 4 quadrants** (`(-0.5,-0.5)→(639.5,359.5)`, `(639.5,-0.5)→(1279.5,359.5)`, `(-0.5,359.5)→…`, `(639.5,359.5)→…`).
- **⇒ OPEN SUB-Q RESOLVED (no mechanism left unverified):** the prior POOLCHK/poolwatch/census "slot 0 = 0xA2000000" reads sampled the **DEGENERATE setup draws** (#0–3, type-0 fetch → 0xA2000000), NOT the content draws. The content draws (#4–7) set slot 0 to a type-3 kVertex pointer with real verts immediately before drawing. "Slot 0 empty" = reading at the wrong (setup) draw. The census `[drawgeo]` SLOT0 shadow likewise reported the setup value because its per-draw read landed on the degenerate draws / the shadow held the last type-0 write. **No contradiction remains.**
- **⚠ SCOPE (rigor):** these 4 content rects (prim=8 numI=3, screen-tiling, −0.5 half-texel, per-640×360-EDRAM-tile) = a fullscreen **BACKDROP** drawn per-tile — NOT the rich UI (the census found prim=5/numI=4 sprites + prim=13/numI=252 text in a RICHER frame). REX_EXECSEGS currently reaches the 3 backdrop segments present in the directory at VdSwap time; the sprite/text segments may need a different trigger frame / appear later in the directory. T2b renders what's reachable first (the backdrop rects — real, screen-space, renderable), then extends.
- **⇒ T2b vkCmdDraw data PINNED per-draw:** prim=8 kRectangleList, numI=3, fetch type-3 kVertex base (per-draw), float2 screen coords. Host transform = screen→Vulkan-NDC `clip=(x/640−1, y/360−1)` (Vulkan NDC y-down matches screen y-down — NO flip), expand the rect (3→4 verts → 2 tris), vkCmdDraw via the menu-quad pipeline → present. New diag (gated, default-safe): `[esdraw]`. Default boot unregressed (tl_execsegs is false unless REX_EXECSEGS set it). Commit `superheher` (not pushed).

### cont.22 /loop — ⭐ T2b-step-2: the title's REAL menu geometry RENDERS COHERENTLY (4 backdrop quadrants on the Vulkan swapchain) — first correct render of title geometry
Wired the carve→bridge→draw path: during a REX_EXECSEGS frame, each content DRAW_INDX (fetch type-3 kVertex, prim 8, numI 3) reads its 3 float2 verts from the live fetch slot-0, derives the kRectangleList 4th corner, expands to 2 triangles, screen→clip transforms, and accumulates into `tl_esVerts`; after the exec loop the frame's batch goes to `rex_render::SubmitMenuGeometry` → the render thread draws it via the menu-quad float2 pipeline (REX_MENUTEST) → present + PPM capture.
- **RESULT (`REX_RENDER=1 REX_MENUTEST=1 REX_EXECSEGS=3` + run-base):** `[render] menu geometry submitted (24 verts)` every frame = **4 rects × 6 verts**, captured /tmp/varianta_menu.ppm. First capture (wrong rect formula `v3=v1+v2-v0`) = 4 distinct **parallelograms** (sheared) — proved the carve→bridge→GPU→present path works end-to-end with REAL title verts, just the rect-corner math was off. **FIX:** Xenos kRectangleList 4th corner = **`v3 = v0 + v2 - v1`**, triangles `(v0,v1,v2)+(v0,v2,v3)` (verified from the RAW dump v0=(640,360) v1=(1280,360) v2=(1280,720) → v3=(640,720) = clean BR quadrant). **Re-capture = 4 CLEAN axis-aligned quadrant rectangles** (TL/TR/BL/BR) tiling 1280×720 exactly — the title's real per-EDRAM-tile (640×360) **BACKDROP**, rendered coherently. Colors = my debug palette (per-quad cycling); the title would texture them.
- **⇒ MILESTONE: variant A now renders the title's REAL menu geometry CORRECTLY** (vs the prior heuristic triangle-soup) — the full path CP-executes the deferred segment → reads each draw's live kVertex verts → triangulates the prim → screen→clip → vkCmdDraw → present, verified by a clean 4-quadrant capture. The breakthrough (verts exist) is now end-to-end demonstrated.
- **⇒ NEXT (T2b cont.):** (1) reach the RICH UI segments (prim=5 numI=4 sprites + prim=13 numI=252 text) — they weren't in the 3 backdrop segments REX_EXECSEGS executed; find their trigger frame / where they enter the device+13568 directory (or a different cmd-buffer); (2) per-draw COLOR/TEXTURE (the debug palette → the title's textures via the 0x4800 fetch texture constants + a textured FS) + the per-draw $worldviewProj (reg 0x4000) for non-screen-space draws; (3) handle the other prims (tri-strip/quad-list) in the carve. The geometry-translation foundation is proven. Default boot UNREGRESSED (exit124/0-crash/71k lines, T2b gated behind REX_EXECSEGS+rex_render::Enabled). Commit `superheher` (not pushed).

### cont.22 /loop — T2b-step-3: DRAW_INDX init-decode BUG fixed → sprite(prim5)/text(prim13) draws REVEALED; their verts are at fetch SLOT 1 (overturns the "slot-1 red herring")
User re-issued "продолжай работу автономно". Investigating where the RICH UI lives, found + fixed a real ExecutePM4 bug + located the sprite/text vertex source.
- **Rich frames DO occur** ([execsegs] NEW-MAX tracker): the device+13568 directory grows from 3 descriptors (backdrop only) to **20 descriptors / ~80 draws** at later swaps (#156, #248, #844, #1001). REX_EXECSEGS executes them; my earlier capture just grabbed swap#3 (the first, backdrop-only frame).
- **⛔→✅ BUG FIXED (ExecutePM4 DRAW_INDX init decode):** the handler read `init = GLD32(addr)` (data[0]) for BOTH op 0x22 and 0x36, but **op 0x22 (DRAW_INDX)'s VGT_DRAW_INITIATOR is data[1]** (data[0] is a control/viz word); only op 0x36 (DRAW_INDX_2)'s is data[0]. This MISDECODED every op-0x22 draw (e.g. a bogus `prim=11 numI=33024` from a `0x8100_000B` word). The census already read data[1] for 0x22; ExecutePM4 didn't. Fixed: `init = (op==PM4_DRAW_INDX) ? GLD32(addr+4) : GLD32(addr)`.
- **⭐ AFTER the fix — the true draw mix per frame ([esdraw] with op + vtxSlot scan):** #0–3 = **op 0x22**: prim=5 numI=4 (**SPRITE**, tri-strip quad), prim=4 numI=6 (tri-list), prim=5, prim=13 numI=252 (**TEXT**, quad-list) — exactly the census's prim5/13. #4–7 = op 0x36 prim=8 (the backdrop rects). So the rich UI draws are **op 0x22** (which the old decode mangled).
- **⭐ Sprite/text VERTEX source LOCATED (vtxSlot scan = first type-3 kVertex fetch slot):** the backdrop draws fetch **slot 0** (kVertex, per-draw 0xA01A87xx). The sprite/text/tri-list draws fetch **slot 1 = 0xA01FE0FC** (the ~10.5MB per-frame pool, `words≈2.75M`), with **slot 0 = their TEXTURE** (type 2). ⇒ **OVERTURNS the cont.22 "slot 1 (0x1FE0FC) is a RED HERRING / no VS fetches it" verdict** (that was from the broken decode + not executing the segments) — slot 1 IS the rich-UI vertex source.
- **⇒ T2b-cont. path:** the sprite/text draws are **op 0x22 (INDEXED)** — data[2]=index base, data[3]=index size; verts in slot 1 (0xA01FE0FC). To render them: read the index buffer + fetch the indexed float2 verts from slot 1 (resolves the old "per-draw offset into the shared pool" question — it's the INDEX BUFFER, readable now that we execute the real packets) + their texture (slot 0) + a textured FS. The backdrop (slot-0 kVertex rects) already renders. New diags (gated): `[esprim]`, `[esdraw]` op+vtxSlot, `[execsegs] NEW-MAX`. Default boot UNREGRESSED (exit124/0-crash/68k lines). Commit `superheher` (not pushed).

### cont.22 /loop — T2b-step-4: ⚠ CORRECTION — the sprite/text draws are AUTO-INDEX (src=2), slot-1 pool HEAD is zeros ⇒ the (known-hard) per-draw vertex-OFFSET problem, now scoped to the executing CP
`[esidx]` measurement (src_select + idx fmt + index buffer + the slot-1 verts at the first indices), for the op-0x22 sprite/text draws:
- **src_select = 2 (kAutoIndex), NOT indexed** — corrects step-3's "op 0x22 ⇒ indexed/data[2]=index base" guess. There is NO index buffer (the data[2]=`0xA0006000` / data[3]=`0x80000000` are stale regs, not an IB since src=2). Auto-index feeds vertex indices 0..numI-1 to the VS.
- **The slot-1 pool HEAD is zeros** (verts at indices [0,1,2] = (0,0),(0,0),(0,0)). So auto-index reading [0,numI) from vbase=0xA01FE0FC (the pool head) yields ZEROS. The REAL verts sit DEEP in the pool (cont.22 found screen-coord rects at +0x2A9F0/+0x31E6C). ⇒ this is exactly the **cont.22 "per-draw vertex OFFSET into the shared slot-1 pool" problem** (the one the heuristic contiguous-collect turned into a triangle-soup) — re-confirmed, now with the draws actually executing.
- **⇒ The backdrop (op-0x36, prim-8, slot-0 kVertex, per-draw bases) renders correctly** because each draw has its own small kVertex pool (no offset needed). The **sprite/text (op-0x22, auto-index, shared slot-1 pool)** need the per-draw offset, which auto-index alone doesn't give from vbase=head. Candidate sources (NOW readable live since the CP executes the real packets + maintains the live reg file — unlike the cont.22 census shadow): (a) the SPRITE/TEXT VS's own vfetch OFFSET field (d2[30:8]) — may differ from the backdrop VS's off=0 (disasm the sprite VS's IM_LOAD_IMMEDIATE, not "all 40 VS"); (b) a live VGT base-vertex reg; (c) the slot-1 fetch BASE actually points deep into the pool per-draw in RICH frames (these were POOR/early frames — the pool may be unpopulated at the head early). 
- **⇒ NEXT (T2b sprite/text):** disasm the SPRITE VS vfetch (which slot + offset it really reads — slot 0 is its texture, so verts are a different slot/offset) AND/OR sample a RICH frame's sprite/text draws (swap#156+, where the pool is populated) + scan slot 1 for the first populated screen-coord region per draw. Resolve the offset → carve → render (prim-5 tri-strip / prim-13 quad-list) → texture (slot-0 fetch + textured FS). The backdrop milestone + the geometry path stand; this is the remaining (genuinely intricate) vertex-addressing layer. New diag (gated): `[esidx]`. Default boot UNREGRESSED. Commit `superheher` (not pushed).

### cont.22 /loop — T2b-step-5: ⚠ CORRECTS step-3/4 — the SPRITE/TEXT VS authoritatively vfetch SLOT 0 (off 0), which is EMPTY (0xA2000000); slot 1 is a confirmed RED HERRING. Their wall = the loader-completion gap, NOT a per-draw offset.
Captured the VS microcode (op 0x2B IM_LOAD_IMMEDIATE) during REX_EXECSEGS execution + decoded the vfetch of the VS active at each sprite/text draw (`[esvf]`, authoritative — the title's own shader, not a heuristic):
- **Every sprite(prim5)/text(prim13)/tri-list(prim4) VS: `vfetch slot=0 fmt=0x25(float2) stride=2dw off=0dw`.** And slot 0 for those draws = **type 0/2** (`0xA2000000` / `0xA5004800`), v0=(0,0). ⇒ **the rich-UI VS read fetch SLOT 0, offset 0 — the SAME slot the backdrop uses — but for these draws slot 0 is the EMPTY 0xA2000000 pool (or a texture), not a kVertex pool.**
- **⚠ CORRECTS step-3/4's "sprite/text verts are at slot 1 (0xA01FE0FC)":** that was a `vtxSlot`-scan artifact (it reported the *first type-3 fetch slot present*, which the VS does NOT actually fetch). The authoritative microcode decode shows the VS fetches **slot 0**. So **slot 1 is a RED HERRING (re-confirmed authoritatively — NO VS vfetches it)**, matching the cont.22 POOLCHK/40-VS conclusion; my step-3/4 over-claimed and is retracted.
- **⇒ The picture is now complete + consistent:** (1) **BACKDROP** (prim-8): slot 0 = a real per-draw kVertex pool (0xA01A87xx) inline in the STAGING buffer → populated → **renders** ✅. (2) **SPRITE/TEXT** (prim-5/13): slot 0 = `0xA2000000`, which the resource-loader (sub_8242BF10, cont.22 unification) populates but STALLS on → **empty/filler (head 0x00000000 across all 60 frames)** → no verts ⛔. So the original cont.22 "vertex-data gap / 0xA2000000 empty" was right **for the rich UI** (it's the sprite/text vertex source); the breakthrough cracked the **backdrop** (a separate inline pool). 
- **⇒ The sprite/text wall = the cont.22 LOADER-COMPLETION problem** (populate 0xA2000000 + set slot-0 = kVertex), NOT a per-draw vertex offset (off=0, authoritative). This is the deep multi-session resource-loader/GPU-completion build (cont.22 loop-iters 5-8 / piece-4 / the unification). A possible non-loader lead: poolwatch caught sub_8242BF10 *memcpy*-ing to 0xA2000000 — its SOURCE may be slot-1's real verts (0xA01FE0FC), i.e. the verts exist at the memcpy source but the copy stalls; rendering from the source would need the per-draw source offset (the old soup-prone problem). New diag (gated): `[esvf]` (VS vfetch decode at the draw via tl_vsUcode from op-0x2B). vulkan_render: capture the RICHEST frame (steady-state shows 12-30 backdrop rects, all 4-quadrant fills, alpha-stacked). Default boot UNREGRESSED (exit137=SIGKILL/0-crash/76k lines). Commit `superheher` (not pushed).

### cont.22 /loop — T2b-step-6: the loader is DEFINITIVELY STUCK (never reaches done over 40s); REX_EXECSEGS does NOT unstall it ⇒ sprite/text need the deep resource-CREATION build
Two experiments connecting the renderer to the loader (REX_POLLDIAG extended with a distinct-state + one-time DONE tracker, uncapped):
- **REX_EXECSEGS + REX_POLLDIAG:** executing the real content segments (firing real interrupts/fences) does **NOT** unstall the loader — its state machine still cycles `2→3→6→8→10→2`. So the loader does NOT wait on draw execution. ⚠ But a SHARPER datum: **`*(child+208)=1` (ready — MATCHES prod) from poll #2 on.** So the **per-child completion IS satisfied**; the blocker is the QUEUE/state-machine level, exactly cont.22 piece-4 (`sub_8224F918` re-submits / the state machine never terminates).
- **40s run, distinct-state tracker:** the loader (singleton obj `0x82657578`) reaches states **{2,3,6,8,10} and NEVER done (1 or 12)** — no `*** LOADER REACHED DONE ***` ever fired. ⇒ the loader is **genuinely STUCK, not merely slow** (definitive — 40s, ~thousands of polls, child ready, never terminates).
- **⇒ DEFINITIVE SCOPING of the sprite/text wall:** the title's resource loader (sub_82248010 staged processor, driven by sub_8224F918) cycles forever even though child[0]'s completion field is ready (=prod's value). It needs GPU resource-CREATION completion (cont.22 loop-iter 8: file I/O works, the GPU upload/compile after it doesn't complete in the stub) — which neither faking (cont.22 force-past FAILED) nor draw-execution (this test) provides. **The sprite/text (+ the whole intro→menu resource load) are blocked on this ONE deep root, now confirmed from the renderer side.**
- **⇒ State of the renderer thread (honest endpoint):** ✅ the CP→Vulkan path works end-to-end (REX_EXECSEGS → DRAW_INDX→vkCmdDraw → the title's real BACKDROP renders, 4 EDRAM-tile quadrants). ⛔ the rich UI (sprite/text) is blocked on the **definitively-stuck resource loader** — a sustained multi-session build (model GPU resource-creation so sub_82248010 terminates), NOT a quick /loop win. The precise unanswered RE question (the only remaining lever short of the full build): **what gates sub_82248010's state-10 → done vs → 2 transition**, given child[0] is already ready=1 (cont.22 piece-4's "why the queue never drains"). Diag: REX_POLLDIAG now tracks distinct states + a DONE flag. Default boot UNREGRESSED (exit137/0-crash/72k lines). Commit `superheher` (not pushed).

### cont.22 /loop — RENDERER ARC CONSOLIDATION + DEEP-BUILD ROADMAP (quick-lever endpoint reached; prevent-reset ruled out by reasoning)
Considered the next planned experiment (hook sub_8224F918 to stop it re-submitting the already-ready child) and **ruled it out as redundant**: cont.22 loop-iter-6 force-past already forced state=done and it re-cycled/stalled, and the re-submit is **driven by the frontend (sub_8214FFD0) needing the resource** — so suppressing the loader's reset can't stop the frontend re-requesting. Every quick lever now converges on one conclusion → consolidating rather than grinding.
- **THIS SESSION'S RENDERER ARC (10 commits, all default-boot-safe, NOT pushed):** (1) BREAKTHROUGH — the "vertex-data gap" was a measurement artifact; the backdrop verts EXIST (3bebeb3). (2) MILESTONE — REX_EXECSEGS executes the deferred device+13568 segments and DRAW_INDX→vkCmdDraw renders the title's REAL backdrop (4 EDRAM-tile quadrants, fd6b265). (3) Fixed the DRAW_INDX op-0x22 init decode (init=data[1], ae27676). (4) Rigorously scoped the rich UI: sprite(prim5)/text(prim13) authoritatively vfetch SLOT 0 = the EMPTY 0xA2000000 pool (d87d586); slot 1 is a confirmed red herring; (5) the resource loader is DEFINITIVELY stuck (never reaches done/40s; child ready=1; execsegs+faking+prevent-reset all fail, 6de9d57).
- **WHAT WORKS NOW:** the full CP→Vulkan translation path (`REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30 REX_EXECSEGS=3 REX_RENDER=1 REX_MENUTEST=1`): execute the deferred segments → per-draw read kVertex verts + triangulate prim + screen→clip → vkCmdDraw → present. Renders the inline-vert backdrop coherently (verified PPM).
- **THE ONE REMAINING WALL = the title's resource loader is stuck on GPU resource-CREATION** (textures + the sprite/text vertex pool at 0xA2000000). All quick stopgaps fail because the title needs the resource to ACTUALLY exist+function downstream (not a forced flag).
- **⇒ DEEP-BUILD ROADMAP (the sustained multi-session work; NOT quick /loop probes):** **Step 1** — pin the exact resource-creation completion the frontend (sub_8214FFD0) checks and finds missing despite the file load (cont.22 narrowed to the post-file-read GPU-create path sub_822484E0→sub_8244D018). **Step 2** — model that creation: when the title requests a GPU texture/vertex-buffer, allocate a real Vulkan VkImage/VkBuffer + return a valid handle + signal completion so the frontend's check passes. **Step 3** — the loader drains → the title's OWN code populates the vertex pool (0xA2000000) + binds textures (NO heuristics/soup) → the sprite/text draws get real verts (slot 0 = kVertex) + textures → render via the (already-working) CP→Vulkan path → the full menu appears. This is the cont.22 RENDERER-DESIGN faithful resource/GPU-completion model — the real fix, well-characterized from both the transition side (cont.22) and the renderer side (this session). Default boot UNREGRESSED. No new code this entry (consolidation; prevent-reset ruled out).
- **CODE-LEVEL confirmation of the done-gate (read sub_82248010, ppc_recomp.29:1231-1514):** the state machine is a **jump-table dispatch on the state value** — `state-2`, `if >9 (state 1 or ≥12) → exit/DONE` (loc_822481C8), else jump-table[state-2] → per-state handler. Each handler **calls a polymorphic vtable method** (e.g. `*(obj->vtable+20)()` then `state←3`) and sets the next state from the result. ⇒ reaching DONE (1/12) requires a handler to return **resource-complete**; there is NO flag to flip (state-forcing = cont.22's failed force-past). The done-gate genuinely depends on the GPU resource existing — **the deep wall confirmed at the source level**, matching all other angles. ⇒ The remaining work (model the title's inlined-XDK-D3D resource OBJECTS so the handlers return complete + the title's own render code works) is a LARGE architectural build, NOT a /loop-iteration task. The renderer milestone (backdrop renders) is the session's delivered value; the full menu awaits the deliberate deep build.

### cont.22 /loop — DEEP BUILD step 1: ⭐ the done-gate FULLY MAPPED — the child's completion flag is ALREADY SATISFIED (*(child+208)=1=prod); the loader cycles on a SPURIOUS external re-init, not a missing resource (testable, possibly-quick)
User chose "Grind the deep build." Read sub_82248010 end-to-end (ppc_recomp.29:1231-1514) + its vtable methods. The state machine MAPPED:
- Jump-table on `state-2` (states 2-11). Each handler calls a vtable resource-op (offsets +8/+20/+24/+32/+36) then sets the next state. **DONE = state 1 or 12** (the `state-2 > 9` exit). State writes: 3,6,7,8,9,10,11, and **DONE via 3 handlers** (loc_822480A0→12, loc_822480A8→1, loc_8224818C→1/12).
- **The done-CHECK handlers** (loc_822480CC/82248128/8224818C) call **`vtable[9]` = `sub_82105948`**, which is **trivially `return *(child+208)`** (ppc_recomp.1:3333 — `lwz r3,208(r3); blr`). Branch: ret==2 → WAIT(stay); ret==3 → state 12 (DONE); **else → state 1 (DONE) or advance**. So **done iff `*(child+208) ∉ {2,3}`**.
- **`*(child+208) = 1`** (polldiag, = prod's ready value). `1 ∉ {2,3}` ⇒ **the done-check WOULD PASS if reached.** Yet the states cycle 2→3→6→8→10 and never reach the done-check. **NO handler in sub_82248010 sets state←2** ⇒ the reset to 2 is **EXTERNAL = sub_8224F918** (cont.22's frontend-driven re-submitter).
- **⇒ REFRAMED HYPOTHESIS (testable, ≠ cont.22 force-past):** the child's resource may be **READY by its own completion flag** (*(child+208)=1=prod); the loader cycles because `sub_8224F918` **spuriously re-inits the child to state 2** before it advances to its done-check. cont.22's force-past FORCED state=done (wrong — bypasses the check); this is different — **PREVENT the spurious re-init so the child reaches its OWN done-check**, which then passes legitimately (via *(child+208)=1). ⚠ NOT asserting it works — *(child+208)=1 may be premature (resource flagged ready but not usable), in which case the menu still fails downstream (back to the deep build). But it's the cheapest decisive next test.
- **⇒ NEXT (experiment):** wrap/instrument sub_82248010 (strong override of the weak alias, calling __imp__sub_82248010) to log state-in→out + *(child+208) — resolve whether the done-check (loc_8224818C) is REACHED (and *(child+208) there). If the reset prevents it: hook sub_8224F918 to skip the ready-child reset + test if the loader drains → menu loads. If the done-check IS reached but *(child+208)≠1 there: the flag is premature → the deep resource build stands. Default boot UNREGRESSED (reading only this entry). Commit `superheher`.

### cont.22 /loop — DEEP BUILD step 2: ⛔ DECISIVE — the child REACHES done but holding it there does NOT unblock the title; the resource is genuinely NULL (spurious-re-init hypothesis REFUTED; state-level shortcut definitively ruled out)
Built `REX_LOADERTRACE` (wrap sub_82248010 — strong override of the weak alias calling __imp__sub_82248010, the established kernel.cpp pattern) + `REX_LOADERLATCH` (hold child[0] at done). Two measured results:
- **TRACE (refutes step-1's "done-check never reached"):** the child DOES reach DONE — `#20 state 3→1 c208=1`, `#80 state 10→1 c208=1` — then `#100 state 2→3` = **re-init'd to 2 and re-processed**. So child[0] **completes (→state 1) REPEATEDLY** but is re-queued forever (exactly cont.22 piece-4). The done-check IS reached; *(child+208)=1; it legitimately completes.
- **LATCH (the decisive test):** held child[0] at state 1 (override the external re-init — STRONGER than cont.22's one-shot force-past). Result: the cycling stops (trace shows `[latched]` after #20), the run does NOT stall early (283k lines vs cont.22 force-past's ~780), **BUT the title keeps SPINNING** (`KeGetCurrentProcessType` = 245k/283k lines = the same idle state as baseline) — **NO transition, NO menu progress, no sub_8210AF90.**
- **⇒ DECISIVE: the spurious-re-init hypothesis is REFUTED.** child[0] reaching/holding done is MEANINGLESS — the title keeps re-requesting because **the RESOURCE the loader should create is genuinely NULL** (not because the state is wrong). The re-init is a SYMPTOM (frontend re-requests a missing resource), not the cause. This definitively **rules out every state-level shortcut** (force-past cont.22, latch, prevent-reset) — they all fail because the title needs the resource to ACTUALLY exist + function. 
- **⇒ The ONLY path is the deep resource-CREATION build** (now confirmed from the strongest possible angle): find the resource-creation sub-op inside the loader's vtable handlers (offsets +8/+20/+24/+32 — the ones that ADVANCE the state, calling a sub-op that should create a GPU texture/buffer but returns null/stub) and model it (create a real Vulkan resource + a valid handle the title's render code can use). New diags (gated, default-safe — exit137/0-crash/73k lines): `REX_LOADERTRACE`, `REX_LOADERLATCH`. NEXT: identify which vtable handler's sub-op creates the (null) resource → model that specific creation. Commit `superheher`.

### cont.22 /loop — DEEP BUILD step 3: the loader's sub-ops are all FILE-I/O + flags (no GPU-create); the create is the INLINED-D3D frontend path — the autonomous RE is COMPLETE, the build is fully scoped
Dumped child[0]'s vtable (0x820DAE0C) via REX_LOADERTRACE + read the resource sub-ops:
- **vtable:** [0]sub_821006E0 [1]**sub_82248480 (the RE-INIT)** [2]sub_822485A0(+8) [3]sub_82248570 [4]sub_82248370 [5]**sub_822484D0(+20)** [6]sub_822484E0(+24) [7]sub_82248530 [8]sub_822485E8(+32) [9]**sub_82105948(+36=done-check=`return *(child+208)`)** [10-19] misc.
- **sub_822484D0 (+20, the "ready" setter) = 8 lines, TRIVIAL: just `*(child+208) = r11`** — sets the ready flag, creates NOTHING. **sub_822485E8 (+32) → sub_8244D230** = 168 lines calling **`NtWriteFile` + `NtWaitForSingleObjectEx`** = FILE I/O (write/cache + wait), not a GPU-create. **sub_822484E0 (+24) → sub_8244D018** = kernel/IO (cont.22). **sub_822485A0 (+8)** = file size (cont.22).
- **⇒ ALL the loader's resource sub-ops examined are FILE-I/O + flag-setting — NONE create a GPU resource.** The loader's job is to **load/process the file and flag ready** (which WORKS — child[0] completes, *(child+208)=1). This **exonerates the loader** (consistent with the latch test: holding the child done changes nothing because the loader was never the gate). 
- **⇒ DEFINITIVE, COMPLETE characterization:** the GPU-resource-CREATE (shader-compile `.xbv`→GPU shader / texture upload) is **DOWNSTREAM of the loader, in the frontend (sub_8214FFD0), as INLINED XDK D3D** — there is no clean hook (cont.22's "XDK D3D inlined" wall). The title loads the file (works), the inlined-D3D create stubs to null, the frontend re-requests → the loader re-loads forever. **The deep build's target = implement the inlined-D3D GPU resource subsystem** (`.xbv`→SPIR-V shader translation [Plume/the 19 .updb], texture decode/upload, buffer creation) so the title's render objects are non-null — i.e. re-implement the Xenos GPU resource layer that prod (Xenia-based) has and variant A lacks.
- **⇒ STATUS — the autonomous RE phase is COMPLETE:** the full chain is now characterized end-to-end (movie→transition→loader→done-gate→re-init→GPU-create→inlined-D3D). The remaining work is the **massive, focused implementation** of the GPU resource subsystem — a multi-session architectural build (likely needing design decisions on bridging the title's inlined-D3D objects to the Vulkan backend), NOT further /loop RE (which has reached its natural limit — every sub-op is now mapped). The renderer milestone (backdrop renders) + the complete characterization are the delivered value. Default boot UNREGRESSED. Commit `superheher`.

### cont.22 /loop — slot-1 sprite/text carve = CONFIRMED SOUP (even with the corrected numI) — the LAST shortcut is closed
User kept choosing "продолжай"; tried the most concrete remaining shot at the visible menu content. The sprite(prim5)/text(prim13) draws' verts were GENERATED at slot 1 (0xA01FE0FC, cont.22); prior carves produced soup but used the BROKEN init decode (garbage numI=33024). Re-tried with the CORRECTED per-draw numI (REX_SPRITECARVE: sequential carve from the dense start, authoring→clip x/884-1,y/521.5-1, prim-5 tri-strip / prim-13 quad-list triangulation; 4164 verts submitted).
- **RESULT = SOUP** (/tmp/sprite.png): a degenerate diagonal triangle over the backdrop quadrants, NOT coherent UI. The corrected numI did NOT fix it. ⇒ **slot 1 is genuinely NOT the draws' reconstructable source** — confirming the authoritative finding (the VS fetches SLOT 0; slot 1 is an intermediate/staging buffer whose layout does not map to the draws). The verts the draws actually consume are at slot 0, which is empty (resource-create stubbed).
- **⇒ The LAST heuristic shortcut is now decisively closed.** Every non-build path is ruled out by experiment: state-level latch (the loader completes but the title still needs the real resource), and slot-1 carve (soup, even with correct numI). **There is NO way to render the sprite/text without the real resource-create populating slot 0** — the deep GPU-resource-subsystem build is the sole remaining path, exhaustively confirmed from every angle this session (~13 iterations) + cont.22 (8) + the variant-B spike (XDK D3D inlined). New gated diag (default-safe — exit137/0-crash/35k lines): `REX_SPRITECARVE` (confirmed-soup; kept as a closed-door record). Commit `superheher`.

### cont.22 /loop — ⭐⭐⭐ FOCUSED BUILD BREAKTHROUGH: the title's REAL menu UI renders — VB-fill capture recovers the per-draw verts the stubbed fetch constant lost
User chose "commit to the focused build." The blocker: the sprite/text draws read fetch slot 0 (0xA2000000, constant 0x02000000 = type-0 invalid stub); the verts went to slot 1 with a per-draw mapping lost in the stubbed resource-create (heuristic carving = soup, 4 attempts). **NEW ANGLE that cracked it:** hook the memcpy `sub_8242BF10` that FILLS the dynamic VBs (`REX_VBFILL`, strong override calling __imp__). Each fill's SOURCE (r4) holds the real per-draw verts BEFORE the copy — the discrete per-draw boundaries heuristics couldn't see.
- **`[vbfill]` capture (measured):** clean per-draw fills — `#0 4v (0,0)(1768,0)…` = full-screen backdrop quad; **`#1 6v (348,261)(932,261)…` = a UI PANEL** (matches cont.22's RE'd panel coords exactly); `#3 504v` = text (local-space glyphs near origin, need per-glyph matrices); `#21 6v (202,203)(1078,203)` = another panel. The fills are in draw order with real authoring(~1768×1043) coords.
- **RENDER (capture the fill source → authoring→clip (x/884-1,y/521.5-1) → triangulate → SubmitMenuGeometry):** filtered to screen-space panels (nv 4-16, span>40, skip the backdrop + local-space text). **RESULT = /tmp/menu_panel.png: a CLEAN red UI PANEL rendered correctly** (the title's real (348,261)-(932,459) menu panel) on the dark bg. **FIRST time variant A renders a real menu UI ELEMENT** (not the backdrop, not soup) — the focused build's approach WORKS: the lost per-draw mapping is RECOVERED via the fill-source capture.
- **⇒ The path to the full menu is now OPEN + concrete:** (1) relax/refine the filter + match fills→draws (by order) for the right per-prim triangulation → render ALL panels; (2) per-glyph text (the 504-vert local-space fills need the per-glyph $worldviewProj — find the per-glyph matrix); (3) textures (the panels' fill textures via the 0x4800 fetch consts + a textured FS). The VB-fill capture is the key that unlocks the per-draw geometry. ⚠ The sub_8242BF10 wrap adds ~6% default-boot overhead (hot memcpy) — TEMPORARY; optimize or compile-gate before keeping. Gated diag: REX_VBFILL. Default boot FUNCTIONAL (exit137/0-crash/68k lines). Commit `superheher`.

### cont.23 /loop — ⛔→🎯 the heuristic VB-capture path is exhausted (text can't be placed); MEASURED the exact wall and PINPOINTED the deep-build entry point
Picked up rendering the menu TEXT (stride-16 glyph quads). Building it forced a rigorous, measured characterization that **corrects BREAKTHROUGH-2's over-broad claim** ("content draws point at real screen-space verts" — true ONLY for the prim-8 backdrop) and closes the heuristic path. Commits `fe2cd51`, `e27b18e`, `a8b0cd4` (all gated, default boot UNREGRESSED: exit137/0-fatal/111k lines, reaches menu state).
- **Text is local-space (measured):** the memcpy text fill = stride-16 `pos.xy + uv.xy`, glyphs at local `(16.5,-0.5)(36.5,-0.5)…` marching right (kerning), NOT screen coords. Rendering the position quads as-is lands them off-screen top-left. A local→screen transform is required. (Removed the disproven heuristic text-render branch; kept the panels, which still render.)
- **REX_EXECSEGS DOES execute the UI draws** (`[esprim]`: prim 5 sprite numI=4, prim 4 quad numI=6, prim 13 text numI=252, prim 8 backdrop numI=3) — but NONE of the UI draws can be rendered from the recorded segment:
  - `[esvf]`: every UI draw's VS reads vertex-fetch **slot 0**, which is EMPTY (`0xA2000000`) or a texture (`0xA5004800`), v0=`(0,0)`. The per-draw vertex binding is GONE. Only prim-8 backdrop has real slot-0 kVertex screen-space verts (and it renders — that's all BREAKTHROUGH-2 actually measured).
  - The real text verts exist only at memcpy-fill time: **DEST=`0xA022FFF0`**, local stride-16. The draw carries NO reference to that addr (slot-0 empty; the `[esdraw]` slot-1 scan finds a STALE `0xA01FE0FC`). At exec time the dynamic VBs read all zeros (recycled). ⇒ address-key correlation is impossible.
  - **The per-draw transform IS recoverable at exec time** (`[esalu]` reg 0x4000): World translate `c0=(1,0,0,333.56) c1=(0,1,0,865.96)` + screen-ortho Proj `c4=(2/1280,0,0,-1) c5=(0,-2/720,0,1)` (Y-flip, 1280×720). **But reg 0x4000 = ALL ZEROS at memcpy-fill time.** ⇒ verts and transform NEVER coexist in time.
  - `[esset]`/`[esset2]`: during segment execution, **ZERO** fetch-constant writes via either SET_CONSTANT or SET_CONSTANT2. The backdrop's slot-0 values are STATIC (set once at boot setup, `0x001A8713`+0x18/quadrant); the UI's dynamic per-frame bindings are simply never emitted into the PM4 stream. ⇒ the binding is done by recomp'd guest D3D code, not PM4.
- **⭐ DEEP-BUILD ENTRY POINT located:** logged the memcpy caller's lr (`0x821F90B0`) → the dynamic-VB fill is called by **`sub_821F8E60`** (ppc_recomp.21.cpp:22258). The call site is a textbook D3D dynamic-VB pattern: **vtable+120 (Lock)** → locked ptr (stack+80 = `0xA022FFF0`); `r5=r29<<4` (size = vertCount×16, confirms stride-16); `bl sub_8242BF10` (memcpy fills the VB); **vtable+124 (Unlock)**. The VB object (`r30`) is a REAL recompiled D3D resource, Lock/Unlock EXECUTE, backing = `0xA022FFF0`. **The missing link = the SetStreamSource+DrawPrimitive that should bind `r30` into the slot-0 fetch constant** — un-emitted/stubbed.
- **⇒ segment-re-exec is a DEAD-END for the UI** (renders only the backdrop). The sole path to the textured menu is restoring that bind+draw. ⭐NEXT (deep build): trace `r30`'s flow after Unlock (in `sub_821F8E60` or its caller) to the bind+draw step; that's where the fetch-constant binding + the textured draw must be reconstructed. New gated diags: `[esalu]` (transform dump), `[esset]`/`[esset2]` (PM4-binding-absence proof), `[text] caller_lr`.
- **Lock/Unlock structure decoded (`sub_821F8E60` @ ppc_recomp.21.cpp:22552-22610):** the VB/draw object **`r30` is obtained from a vtable+200 call** (loc 22556) on the renderer; then `r30->vtable+120` = **Lock**(r4=**13** primType[text quad-list], r5=r29 vertCount, r6=**16** stride, r7=&stack+80 outPtr) → fills outPtr=`0xA022FFF0`; `bl sub_8242BF10` fills the verts; `r30->vtable+124` = **Unlock** (loc 22604), which EXECUTES (PPC_CALL_INDIRECT_FUNC) but emits NO PM4 binding ([esset]=0). ⇒ the draw-submit is the VB object's **vtable+124 (vtable[31])** method — it runs but its D3D GPU-submit is stubbed (doesn't bind slot-0 / emit DRAW_INDX). ⭐DEEP-BUILD next step: capture `r30`'s vtable addr at runtime (wrap sub_821F8E60), read the vtable+124 method, and RE why it doesn't emit the bind+draw (the stubbed inlined-D3D submit to reconstruct).

### cont.23 /loop — ⭐ UI TEXT GEOMETRY RENDERS; the verts↔transform bridge (count-correlation) is VALIDATED (commits fe2052f7-area: REX_UITRACE, fe2e5b7 REX_UITEXT)
Continued the deep build. Captured the VB obj's methods then BUILT the bridge between the disjoint verts (fill-time) and transform (exec-time) windows — and it renders.
- **`REX_UITRACE` (PPCInvokeGuest lr-match capture):** the VB object `r30`=`0x000E3690` (vtable `0x820E0B10`); **Lock = `sub_822052B0`** (calls `sub_821C48B0(device)` → the dynamic-buffer allocator returning `0xA022FFF0`, stores it, returns S_OK); **Unlock = `sub_822052F8`** = TRIVIAL: `*(device+48) = *(device+13652)` (13652 = 13568+84, near the segment directory) — a device build-cursor update, **NOT a draw**. ⇒ the draw is recorded into the segment by a separate traversal; the **ALU transform IS recorded** (reg 0x4000 readable at exec time), only the vertex binding is not.
- **The text VB `0xA022FFF0` reads ZEROS at exec time** (recycled) — so verts truly exist only at memcpy time; transform only at exec time. Bridged them:
- **`REX_UITEXT`:** guest thread snapshots each text-glyph fill (stride-16, by vert COUNT, deduped, persistent); the swap thread pairs each prim-13 draw to the snapshot whose `count == numI` (a strong discriminator) and applies the live reg-0x4000 transform (World-translate + screen-ortho Proj) → clip-space glyph quads → render.
- **RESULT (`REX_UITEXT_FIT` text-only view): 2 ROWS of proportional glyph cells = the title's real 252-vert/63-glyph text label, correct per-glyph kerning + line breaks** (PPM verified; image sent to user). **The full text pipeline works end-to-end** (capture→snapshot→count-correlate→transform→present), and the **count-correlation is DETERMINISTIC for the static menu** (disproves the cont.22 "order-correlation = phantom" worry — count+order pins it).
- ⚠ **Honest limits:** (1) glyphs are solid debug-colored cells — readable text needs the font atlas (0xA5004800) sampled with the per-glyph UVs (captured in the snapshot pos+uv but currently only pos used). (2) **This label's game-accurate placement is OFF-SCREEN** — every prim-13 draw has World=(333.6, **866.0**), and 866 > the Proj's ~714 screen height ⇒ clip.y≈-1.4. The 3 executed segments contain one off-screen text block; the visible dialog text is in segments REX_EXECSEGS doesn't reach. The FIT view maps local coords on-screen to validate the geometry. ⭐NEXT: (a) the font-atlas TEXTURE pipeline (UV + sampler) for readable glyphs; (b) reach the on-screen text (more segments / the binding restoration). Default boot UNREGRESSED (0 fatal). All gated: REX_UITEXT/REX_UITEXT_FIT/REX_UITRACE.

### cont.23 /loop — ⭐ RE-GROUNDING: the render path is PROVEN for geometry, but ALL UI textures are EMPTY ⇒ the loader is THE blocker (confirms cont.22 from the rendering side). Commits 87d5d1f, 1ec4962, 532ec9f.
Surveyed the executed scene + probed its textures — and re-grounded the whole RENDERER phase.
- **`REX_SCENE` (per-draw survey):** the device+13568 segments draw a fixed **~7-8 elements/frame**: 4× prim-8 backdrop quadrants (textured from EDRAM `0xB0000000`); 1× prim-4 textured quad **ON-screen** (World=(64,36)→clip(-0.90,0.90)); off-screen 1× prim-5 sprite (World=(-253,-226)) + 1× prim-13 text (World=(334,866)). The reachable content is **SPARSE** — consistent with the real game's simple menu (background + a few buttons), not a rich text menu. (The prim-8 backdrop's World is irrelevant — it uses real screen-space slot-0 verts.)
- **`[scene-tex]`/`[atlas]` (texture probes):** the backdrop's EDRAM texture `0xB0000000` is **ALL ZEROS** (nz=0/256), AND the STATIC font/sprite atlas `0xA5004800` is **ALL ZEROS** too. ⇒ **EVERY UI texture is empty in variant A** — the texture LOADING/upload never completed.
- **⭐ RE-GROUNDING (honest, measured):** the geometry render path is **PROVEN** (backdrop quads + panels + text glyph-cells render via the debug menu-quad pipeline) — but it has **no textures to draw**, because the resource loader is stuck (the **cont.22** finding, now RECONFIRMED from the rendering side: textures never load). **The render path is NOT the blocker; the loader/GPU-resource-completion is.** variant A's Vulkan is present-only (no real PM4→Vulkan render-target/texture-decode renderer); a textured, recognizable menu is gated on the deep **cont.22 loader build** (resource-creation/GPU-completion), not on more rendering work. ⇒ **the session's rendering exploration has reached its useful conclusion** (geometry path done; the wall is the loader). The remaining cont.22 levers stand: sub_82248010 state-10→done gate, sub_8214FFD0/sub_8224F918 re-request, + the real GPU resource-creation (texture decode/upload, shader compile) that makes the loader's resources non-null. Default boot UNREGRESSED. Gated diags: REX_SCENE + [scene-tex]/[atlas].

### cont.24 /loop (follow-up) — ⛔→📐 sprite-texturing is a MEASURED DEAD-END (no per-draw texture identity); the tractable disk-resource path is EXHAUSTED ⇒ PAUSE (commit c330e50)
After task #8 (backdrop textured), the next disk-resource step was to texture the SPRITE/panel draws. Per the project's rigor ethos (measure before asserting), I first MEASURED what textures those draws reference — it ruled the step out decisively.
- **Extended REX_SCENE** to decode each draw's bound-texture **dimensions** (Xenos 2D fetch constant: width-1 d2[12:0], height-1 d2[25:13], fmt d1[5:0]) — the dims are the key to matching a sprite to a disk `.png`. Gated, default-safe by construction (fully inside `if(getenv("REX_SCENE"))`).
- **⭐ MEASURED (`REX_EXECSEGS=3 REX_SCENE=1` + run-base):** the executed scene is a stable ~7-draw/frame cycle. **prim-5 (sprite numI4), prim-4 (tri-list numI6), prim-13 (text numI252) draws ALL have `tex=0x0`** — i.e. NO texture fetch constant set at draw time (not "empty texture" — the per-draw BINDING doesn't exist; it's loader-gated, the cont.23 wall). The **prim-8 backdrop** references **`0xB0000000` (EDRAM render-target), decoded 1×1, empty** = the runtime-composed RT, NOT a disk asset (so task #8's heuristic disk bg was the right call). `[scene-tex]` 0xB0000000 + `[atlas]` 0xA5004800/0xA5004000 = **all zeros** (loader stuck — re-confirms cont.23). Only the backdrop + ONE prim-4 are on-screen; sprites/text are off-screen.
- **⭐ Asset survey:** `LevelSelectBG.png` is the **ONLY 1280×720 full-screen background** in the entire `media/Assets` tree (no main-menu/title/attract full-screen bg exists) ⇒ task #8's default was the only/optimal choice. Option (b) "menu-accurate bg" is closed.
- **⇒ DECISIVE CONCLUSION — the tractable disk-resource path is EXHAUSTED:** (a) sprite-texturing = DEAD-END (no per-draw texture identity to map — `tex=0x0`, loader-gated); (b) better backdrop bg = none exists (LevelSelectBG is the only one, already used); (c) per-draw color = low-value polish. Every remaining avenue — the rich/readable menu (on-screen sprites, buttons, text) — converges on the ONE wall: the stuck loader / **deep GPU resource-creation build** (Xenos tiled-texture decode + .xbv→SPIR-V + EDRAM render-targets + resolves + real CP completion), which the project has established across ~15 continuations is a *poor /loop fit with no shortcut*.
- **⏸ PAUSING the autonomous /loop.** This /loop session DELIVERED a clean headline win — **task #8: the menu backdrop renders the title's real game art** (cont.24, commit 5a76116) — and this follow-up rigorously BOUNDS what's left (sprite-texturing measured-dead-end; the only full-screen bg already used). Spinning further /loop iterations would be low-value polish or re-treading the loader wall. **Decision for the user:** (1) commit to the deep loader/GPU-resource-creation build as a focused sustained session (the path to the rich menu), (2) accept low-value polish increments (per-draw colors / render the on-screen prim-4), or (3) redirect. All findings/tools in this NIGHT-LOG + NEXT-SESSION-PROMPT (top) + the sp_varianta_bootstrap memory.

### cont.24 /loop — ⭐⭐ TASK #8 DONE: the menu BACKDROP renders the title's REAL game art (UV-correct, matches source 1:1) — textured-geometry bridge wired end-to-end (commit 5a76116)
The disk-resource path now textures the **actual carved title geometry**, not just a standalone test quad: the backdrop quadrants render the real menu background `.png`. Built + validated this /loop.
- **New bridge `rex_render::SubmitTexturedGeometry(posUV, vertCount)`** (rex_render.h/.cpp) + a growable host-visible pos.xy+uv.xy VB (`EnsureTexGeoVB`). `LoadBackgroundOnce()` loads a 1280×720 background `.png` (default `media/Assets/Frontend/Graphics/LevelSelectBG.png`; `REX_BGTEX=<path>` override) into the textured pipeline during `Init` (after the command pool — `UploadTexture` blocks). PresentOnce draws the submitted backdrop through `g_texPipe`+the background sampler FIRST (viewport/scissor hoisted before the pipeline binds), then the debug menu-quads (panels/text) composite ON TOP. All gated **`REX_MENUTEX`** (shares the `REX_MENUTEST` present path).
- **CP side (kernel.cpp):** in the prim-8 backdrop carve, when `REX_MENUTEX`, emit each quadrant as 6× (pos.xy clip + uv.xy) into a new `tl_esTexVerts` (instead of the debug `tl_esVerts`) with **synthetic UVs `u=x/1280, v=y/720`** — so each of the 4 quadrants samples its own region of the 1280×720 background and the full image reassembles. Submitted via the new bridge after the EXECSEGS frame.
- **⭐ RESULT** (`REX_RENDER=1 REX_MENUTEST=1 REX_MENUTEX=1 REX_EXECSEGS=3` + run-base, AMD POLARIS11): `[render] disk-resource: loaded PNG LevelSelectBG.png (1280×720)` + uploaded; **`textured geometry submitted (24 verts)`** = exactly 4 quadrants × 6 verts. `/tmp/varianta_menu.ppm` (1280×720) **matches the source background 1:1** — the radial blue/white sunburst + its black letterbox bands reproduce exactly (PPM→PNG, viewed + pixel-stat compared: capture mean 82,113,117 stddev 69 vs source 57,89,125 stddev 73; the source's pink center is masked by the translucent debug panels overlaid on top). **The UV mapping is faithful; the backdrop is real art, not a flat fill or the EDRAM stand-in.** 0 Vulkan errors, 0 crashes (exit-124), default boot UNREGRESSED (no `REX_RENDER` → headless boot exit-124, 398k lines, 0 crash markers). Image sent.
- **⇒ MILESTONE:** variant A renders the title's real menu backdrop ART textured onto the title's own carved geometry via the disk-resource bypass — the first *recognizable* (vs debug-colored) render of menu content. Reuses the proven textured pipeline (`634e013`) + geometry carve (`fd6b265`) + the new submit bridge.
- **⚠ Honest limits (unchanged from the plan):** this textures the SPARSE content the stuck title builds (backdrop + a few debug panels + the 1 off-screen text label) — NOT the rich menu (still needs the loader). `LevelSelectBG.png` is a *heuristic* full-screen background (the title's real backdrop is a runtime-composed EDRAM render-to-texture, not one png), chosen to prove the path; the menu-accurate bg would be picked by context/name. The debug panels are still flat-colored (would need the UI sprite atlas + per-draw texture identity). Text glyphs remain blocked on this path (font atlas is TTF-rasterized at runtime, no disk `.png`).
- **⭐NEXT (tractable, disk-resource path):** (a) texture the SPRITE/panel draws (prim-5/13) with a UI atlas `.png` via `SubmitTexturedGeometry` — needs the per-draw texture identity (which atlas + UVs; the plan flags this as the uncertain part); (b) pick the menu-accurate backdrop bg by context rather than the LevelSelectBG stand-in; (c) per-draw color/alpha from the ALU constants for the textured draws. The rich/readable menu remains gated on the deep loader build (unchanged). Gated diags retained; run-base `REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`.

### cont.23 /loop — ⭐ REAL GAME ART RENDERS from disk (.png via libpng) — disk-resource path validated end-to-end (commit 5aedc7c)
Added PNG decode (libpng simplified API, linked via CMakeLists) → `LoadPNGToTexture`: a `media/Assets/*.png`
→ RGBA → `UploadTexture`. `REX_TEXFILE=<path>` selects a real `.png` (else the checker). **RESULT: REX_TEXTEST
+ REX_TEXFILE=.../SouthParkBanner.png renders the ACTUAL game banner** ("SOUTH PARK — LET'S GO TOWER DEFENSE
PLAY!", Cartman/logo) on the textured quad, via the real `.updb`-derived SPTextured shader (PPM verified, image
sent). ⇒ **the disk-resource path is fully validated: `.png` → libpng → VkImage → textured pipeline → present =
variant A renders the game's real art assets, bypassing the stuck loader.** Default boot UNREGRESSED.
- ⚠ **Text is blocked on this path:** the Fonts dir has TTFs (ariblk/comic/southpark.ttf), NOT a font-atlas
  `.png` — the title runtime-rasterizes the atlas (0xA5004800, empty due to the loader), so the captured glyph
  UVs have no disk equivalent (can't align a self-rasterized font to the title's atlas layout).
- ⭐NEXT (task #8): texture the actual menu GEOMETRY — UV plumbing (a `SubmitTexturedGeometry(clipXY,uv)` bridge
  + the textured pipeline for submitted geometry) + map draws→art: backdrop quadrants → a background `.png` with
  synthetic per-quadrant UVs (screen-pos→[0,1]); sprites → UI atlas `.png`. This is the path to a recognizable
  textured backdrop. (Mapping has uncertainty — runtime-composed EDRAM backdrop, runtime sprite atlases.)

### cont.23 /loop — ⭐ TEXTURED PIPELINE WORKS (real .updb shader, UV-correct) — disk-resource path core proven (commit 634e013)
Built + validated the textured UI Vulkan pipeline (task #8). `CreateTexturedPipeline`: descriptor-set layout
(combined image sampler, set0/binding0) + pos.xy+uv.xy vertex input (stride 16) + {mvp,color} push const +
alpha blend; shaders = `menutex.vert` / `SPTextured.frag` (the real ported `.updb` HLSL = `texture(diffuse,
uv)*color`). `UploadTexture`: RGBA8 → device-local VkImage (staging + one-time copy + layout barriers) + view
+ sampler + descriptor pool/set. **RESULT (REX_TEXTEST): a clean UV-correct orange/cyan CHECKERBOARD rendered
by the real SPTextured FS**, alongside the menu-quad rects (PPM verified, 0 Vulkan errors, image sent). The
full textured path is proven end-to-end (pos+uv input + sampler descriptor + device-local upload + the
`.updb`-derived shader + blending). All gated (REX_TEXTEST); default boot UNREGRESSED. ⭐NEXT: PNG decode
(stb_image) → load a real `.png` (the font atlas `media/Assets/Fonts/` / Frontend art) + plumb the REX_UITEXT
snapshots' captured per-vertex UVs through this pipeline → texture the actual menu geometry (readable text).

### cont.23 /loop — ⭐ NEW TRACTABLE DIRECTION: bypass the stuck loader via DISK resources (commits 7bb214d, 27169ae)
After exhaustively confirming the loader wall (below), examined the game files (`private/extracted/media/`)
and found a path AROUND it — the game ships every resource on disk, so the renderer can load them directly
instead of waiting for the loader:
- **PS shaders:** `media/shaders/*.updb` (19, all `ps_3_0`) are **XML carrying the ORIGINAL HLSL source**
  inline. `Simple.psh` = `tex2D(diffuseTexture, In.Tex) * In.Color` (the textured-sprite PS). Names map to
  materials (SPBackdropTextured/Untextured, SPTextured, SPHud*, SpMovie, Simple). The matching `.xbv`
  (Simple.xbv = 612 B = child[0]'s blocked resource) is the compiled microcode.
- **Head start found:** the HLE spike already ported 5 of these to GLSL (`tools/shaderc/ported/{Simple,
  SPTextured,SPUntextured,SimpleCol,SpMovie}.frag`) + a `shaderc` toolchain (`build.sh`, libshaderc).
- **Textures:** 659 `.png` under `media/Assets/{Frontend,hud,Global,Fonts,...}` (the runtime `.xmc` are the
  tiled versions of the same art). Decode `.png`→RGBA→VkImage.
- **VS:** not in the `.updb` set (all PS) — wrote `menutex.vert` (pos.xy+uv.xy → reg-0x4000 World+Proj mvp →
  clip+uv+color). Compiled menutex.vert + SPTextured.frag → SPIR-V (`runtime/menutex_shaders.h`).
- **⇒ this textures the SPARSE content the stuck title builds** (a textured version of the current menu —
  backdrop + a few sprites + the 1 text label), NOT the rich menu (which still needs the loader to progress
  the title) — but it's FAR more tractable than the loader build (avoids the inlined-D3D wall), produces a
  real textured result, and reuses the proven geometry path. NEXT (task #8): CreateTexturedPipeline
  (descriptor-set sampler + pos+uv input) + `.png`→VkImage upload + UV-carrying submit → texture the geometry.
  Plan: `GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN.md` "ALTERNATIVE PATH". Risks: draw→png mapping, UV alignment, EDRAM backdrop.

### cont.23 /loop — loader 20-child survey + the sustained-build conclusion (commit a75d1c6)
- **`[children]` (REX_POLLDIAG 20-child survey, child[i]=0x82657578+i*216):** at the loader's active poll, **child[0]=state 2 (processing), children[1..19]=state 0 (not started).** ⇒ the loader runs children SEQUENTIALLY; child[0] never completes (cycles 2→3→6→8→10, null resource) → the other 19 never begin. cont.22's child[0] focus was correct; it's the SINGLE sequential blocker.
- **⇒ CONCLUSION (both sides agree):** rendering-side (textures empty) + loader-side (child[0] stuck on a null resource) both point to ONE wall: **child[0]'s GPU resource-create**, which cont.22 established is inlined XDK-D3D submitting create-PM4 + waiting on a GPU completion variant A's CP never produces — and cont.22 PROVED fakes fail (force-state/latch/fence-forward; the title needs the REAL resource). The full chain: rich/textured menu → real GPU resources → the GPU-resource subsystem (Xenos tiled-texture decode + .xbv→SPIR-V shader translation [ref: Plume / the 19 .updb] + EDRAM render-targets + resolves + real CP completion) modeled in ExecutePM4. **No shortcut exists.** This is a massive, sustained, deliberate build with no quick visible payoff — exactly cont.22's "poor /loop fit" verdict, now re-confirmed exhaustively from every angle this session. ⇒ further fast /loop diagnostics re-tread cont.22; the deep build needs a focused sustained effort (or a debug prod-oracle build to cross-check), per cont.22's standing recommendation. The autonomous /loop has DELIVERED its value: corrected BREAKTHROUGH-2, the text-geometry render, and this complete, two-sided characterization of the wall.

## cont.25 (2026-06-05, /loop "Deep loader/GPU-resource-creation build") — RE-GROUNDING: the loader is NOT the wall; the renderer is

User chose option (1) from the cont.24 pause (the deep build). Before building, I measured the loader/completion
machinery from scratch (the project's rigor rule). The measurement **corrects the cont.23-24 "child[0] stuck
looping, produces a null resource" framing.** New gated diag `REX_LOADERPROBE` (kernel.cpp), run-base
`REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`, default boot unregressed (18s clean, exit124).

**1. Loader state machine sub_82248010 (ppc_recomp.29:1231) FULLY DECODED.** state @child+136; dispatch
`switch(state-2)`: 2→vtable[5]=sub_822484D0; 4/5/6→vtable[6]=sub_822484E0; **8→vtable[2]=sub_822485A0 (FILE
READ:** reads src=*(child+160), size=*(child+168), calls *(child+0)→vtable[3], sets ready *(child+208)=1);
9→vtable[8]=sub_822485E8; 3/6/7/10/11→done-check vtable[9]. **The done-check sub_82105948 is TRIVIAL:
`return *(child+208)`** (the ready flag) — returns 2⇒pending(stay), 3⇒state12, else⇒state1 + finalize
(`*(child+152) += *(child+168)`, the dest cursor).

**2. child[0]=0x82657578 is an IDLE on-demand loader, NOT a stuck loop.** [ldprobe] (per-completion dump):
child[0] reads DISTINCT resources into scratch 0x02E94610 — sizes 0x23DA, 0x506ED, **0x264=612=Simple.xbv**,
0x174, 0x1427, 0x15C7, 0x62, … — each completing ready=1. [ldframe] (time-based survey on the vblank pump):
child[0] sits at **state 0 / ready=1 most frames**, occasional state-8 loads; an early BURST of ~50+ completions
(~0-14s) then quiet. children[1..19] never leave state 0 (likely a RED HERRING — for other game states, not the
menu). ⇒ the cont.23-24 "cycles 2→3→6→8→10 forever / null resource" was the **WORKER-POLL snapshot view**
(worker sub_822481E0 polls child+136 for {1,12} at KeDelay(10) granularity and rarely catches the transient
done; the state machine DOES reach state 1 — [ldtrace] "3→1","10→1").

**3. Asset-progression map ([asset] = timestamped NtCreateFile, 65 opens):** boot (default.xex, ArcadeLogo.ptc,
audio xgs, UI.xzp) → StringsId.lua/strings.bin → 3 fonts → **ALL ~19 shaders** (Simple, SpTextured,
SPBackdrop{,Un}Textured, SpMovie, SPHud*, SpDropShadow, SimpleCol, …) → **intro movie sp_xbox_0_intro.wmv**
(vbc538) + audio banks + Lua scripts → global assets (lipsynctextures, phonemes, lipsyncanims, subtitles,
moviesubtitles, AnimTags, Animblock) → **Scrapbook Stickers.xmc + global/textures/global.bin** (vbc~864 ≈14s) →
**STOPS** (no further opens for the rest of a 44s run). **NO menu-screen art is EVER requested by the title**
(LevelSelectBG etc. — cont.24's textured backdrop loaded that png from DISK directly, not via the title).

**4. Title is NOT deadlocked — stable frontend render loop.** Main-thread gdb bt at steady state (~20s):
`main→_xstart→sub_82249638→sub_82249678→sub_82249970→sub_82249AD0→sub_82150970(FRONTEND, per cont.22)
→sub_821BF298→sub_821C2388`; also caught in `sub_82200180→sub_822050B8→sub_821C48B0(dyn-VB alloc→0xA022FFF0)
→sub_821D6AC8→sub_821D66E8→sub_8242BF10(memcpy)` = actively filling UI vertex buffers each frame.
**sub_821BF298 (ppc_recomp.16:10344) = the GPU-completion/work-queue drain:** reads completion obj
device+10896(0x2A90); if arg2 r4≠0 AND count *(dev+12924)>0, iterates `count` work items at dev+12928 (stride
16) calling handler vtable[9] of *(dev+12900). [bf298] probe: **count=4 items/frame, r4≠0, item0=`[0,0,0x280,
0x168]` (0x280×0x168 = 640×360 = the EDRAM tile), IDENTICAL frame #0 → #16000.** ⇒ the completion drain RUNS
FINE (not empty, not blocked) — the title renders a stable untextured state and simply never advances.

**5. Input RULED OUT.** REX_SKIPINTRO (injects START+A via XamInputGetState) → SAME 65 assets (just faster,
global.bin vbc560 vs 864) → same stall. Not waiting for a controller.

**6. Secondary bug (NOT the wall):** at ~vbc1530 (~24s) child[0]'s array (0x82657578) is overwritten with path
strings ("game"/"Glob(al)"/"\Meshes\…") — the known string-write class (lr=0x82204D08). The asset-stop is at
~14s, BEFORE this ⇒ the corruption doesn't cause the no-advance; likely the 45-50s SIGSEGV precursor (FOUND, not
root-caused — a stability-pass item, watchpoint the store).

**⇒ MEASURED CONCLUSION (supersedes the cont.23-24 loader framing).** Loader file-read AND the frontend
completion-drain both WORK. The wall to the rich menu is the **missing RENDERER**: variant A has NO Xenos
texture-decode/create, NO real draw-state→VkPipeline, and the inlined XDK-D3D bind+draw+texture-create was
**stubbed by the recomp** (the cont.24 "tex=0x0 / no per-draw binding" is recomp-stubbed, NOT loader-gated). The
title gates its advance on SEEING real rendered results (cont.21's "A↔B coupling"), which variant A can't
produce. **The build = GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN pieces 2–5 / cont.21 PILLAR B (Xenos texture decode + .xbv→SPIR-V
+ real draw translation + reconstruct the D3D render path), NOT the loader "STEP 0"** — STEP 0 was mis-aimed at
child[0], which completes fine. ⚠ Honest open Q (NOT asserting): whether faithful GPU completion ALONE advances
the title or it needs real pixels — cont.21 says the latter (build A+B together). This /loop's value: a fresh,
rigorous re-grounding that redirects the effort from a phantom "loader unblock" to the real renderer build, with
a complete asset map + the exact frontend stall chain. Diag retained (gated, default-safe): `REX_LOADERPROBE`
([ldprobe]/[ldsummary]/[ldframe]/[asset]/[bf298]) + the sub_821BF298 hook. Commit pending (NOT pushed).

### cont.25 — RENDERER BUILD started (user chose it): wall characterization + R0 keystone isolated

User chose "start the renderer build". I characterized the target, then isolated the keystone (commits d636ec0,
e9a1fb9 + pending).

**Scene characterization (REX_SCENE, REX_EXECSEGS=3):** per-frame executed menu scene = sprite(prim5)/tri(prim4)/
text(prim13) draws all **tex=0x0** (no texture bound) + 4× backdrop(prim8) sampling EDRAM **0xB0000000 (1×1,
zeros)** + content mostly OFF-SCREEN (only the prim-4 at (64,36) on-screen). Font atlas 0xA5004800/0xA5004000 =
all zeros. ⇒ THREE distinct stubbed texture sources (sprite-create, EDRAM-RT, TTF-atlas), and the scene is a
pre-menu/loading state — **no incremental visible payoff** without the title advancing (cont.21 A↔B). Reinforces
cont.22-24 "massive sustained build", corrected target = renderer.

**R0 keystone (REX_TEXWATCH):** GPU texture memory IS allocated — MmAllocatePhysicalMemoryEx (g_physNext from
0xA0000000) = 442 blocks incl. 5×`0xE1000`(924KB) + 11×`0x44000`(272KB). Flagged the first 924KB block: (a) gdb
hardware-watchpoint on its first dword = never written over ~85s; (b) headless 3-offset sample (0/64KB/900KB) =
off0 gets a tiny header `0x01000000`, the BULK stays ZERO all run. Atlas stays zero. **[texread] filename trace
(decisive):** audio (MainWaveBank.xwb 22MB, MainSoundBank*.xsb) reads DIRECTLY into the GPU window (0xA0000000+),
but EVERY texture/UI file (UI.xzp 23MB, lipsynctextures.bin, fonts, movie) reads into **SYSTEM memory** — none
into a GPU texture block. ⇒ **THE missing step = the decode+upload (system-mem texture → guest GPU texture mem +
Xenos untile + fetch-constant setup) NEVER RUNS.** Keystone isolated. R1 open Q: stubbed no-op (just implement
decode+copy+fetch-const, ref Xenia texture_conversion) vs A↔B-gated. Plan §R0/R1/R2 (GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN.md).
New gated diag: `REX_TEXWATCH` (+[texwatch]/[texread], +the [ldframe] texture-block population sample), `REX_TEXTRAP`
(gdb-only SIGTRAP). Default boot unregressed (12s smoke clean). Commits pending (NOT pushed).

**cont.25 /loop R1 — CORRECTS R0's pessimism (REX_TEXBIND):** instrumented the texture-fetch d1 bind chokepoint
(WriteGpuReg, ring+segments). The title binds **35 distinct real textures** (bases 0xA4023000…0xA5F5B000) + EDRAM
⇒ **the bind path WORKS (not stubbed)**. Sampling each bound texture's data: **14 of 35 are POPULATED** (nz=64/64,
real varied pixels — 0xA4188000/0xA4739000/0xA4023000/0xA4354000/…), 22 empty (EDRAM-RT + deferred). ⇒ R0's
"populate never runs" was an unlucky single-block sample (0xA4949000 happened to be one of the empty 22); the
decode/populate path WORKS for many textures, and real texture DATA exists in guest GPU mem. The gap is NARROW:
connect the populated textures to the executed draws. ⚠ [texbind] sees slots 0..42 but REX_SCENE only scanned
0..31 — its "tex=0x0" was partly a too-small scan. NEXT (R1 cont.): widen the per-draw scan to 0..42, correlate
executed-draw→populated-texture, sample via g_texPipe (cont.24) → first real textured UI draw. Gated diag
`REX_TEXBIND` ([texbind] + per-bind data sample). Commits pending (NOT pushed).

**cont.25 /loop R1-cont + R2.** R1-cont (commit 6918042): widened the per-draw texture scan to slots 0..42 +
populated-check — the EXECUTED menu draws STILL bind NO texture (sprite/text/tri = slot −1; backdrop = empty
EDRAM). The 14 populated textures are bound by OTHER draws; AND the binds are RUN-TO-RUN VARIABLE (36 once, 1 in
4 retries — cont.12 NOTOKEN race). ⇒ both walls root in the title not advancing to the interactive menu.
**R2 — the A↔B advance gate, precisely localized:** intro→menu transition `sub_82163118` is gated behind byte
**0x828E82A6**, set by prod via **sub_8210AF90** (chain sub_82250420[tid=10]→sub_8211B740[718-line handler]→
sub_8210AF90). MEASURED (REX_INITDIAG/REX_TRACEB740/new REX_ADVGATE): sub_82250420 ✓ + sub_8211B740 ✓ run, but
**sub_8210AF90 NEVER runs** (byte stays 0). [b740] inside sub_8211B740: calls at 0x8211B7D4(sub_82118E10→1),
0x8211B804(sub_82248F18→0x0133F260), then JUMPS to the tail 0x8211BE60(sub_82249018) — **skipping the middle
block** holding the sub_8210AF90 dispatch at **0x8211B91C** (vtable[33] of the screen-state global *(0x828E83C0)).
REX_ADVGATE: 0x8211B91C/0x8211B964 NEVER reached (no success, no INDIRECT-NULL). The loc_8211B81C→dispatch path
is a LINEAR run of direct calls (sub_82131758/8213E7E8/82132918/8212BE48/8211BD60/82110BE8/82267630) ⇒ the divert
is a non-returning middle call or a longjmp/SEH unwind to the tail. **XFLAG force = broken stopgap:** forces the
byte → state machine advances PREMATURELY → INDIRECT-NULL crash at sub_8215DE84 (0xFFFFFFFF) + only 12 assets (vs
65). NEXT (R2 cont.): gdb single-step sub_8211B740 from 0x8211B804 to find the exact divert, OR prod-oracle
compare (why prod reaches sub_8210AF90 — a return value / global state that differs). cont.21 "A↔B" root; the
proper fix makes the title advance naturally. New gated diag `REX_ADVGATE` ([advgate]). Commits pending (NOT pushed).

**cont.25 /loop R2 cont. — the advance gate UNIFIES with the loader/GPU-create wall.** Drilled the divert in
sub_8211B740 (REX_ADVGATE, hooks logging ENTER/RET of each middle call, filtered to the sub_8211B740 call-site):
the linear chain sub_82131758→sub_8213E7E8→sub_82132918→sub_8212BE48→sub_8211BD60(0x8211B888) all ENTER+RET
cleanly, then **sub_8211BE68 (0x8211B894) ENTERs but NEVER RETURNs** (4/4 runs, 38s). ⇒ the dispatch at
0x8211B91C (→ sub_8210AF90, the transitions-enable byte 0x828E82A6 setter) is never reached → the title never
advances. **WHY sub_8211BE68 blocks:** the 18s all-thread bt shows its thread is deep in the LOADER —
`sub_82250420[tid10]→sub_8211B740→sub_8211BE68→sub_822487C8→sub_82448158→sub_8244FE80→sub_8242BF10(memcpy)`.
sub_8211BE68 (91-line fn: an indirect call, then if(r11!=0) calls sub_8224F890/sub_82250110/sub_82110728/
sub_822501C8) drives a resource load via sub_822487C8 that DOESN'T COMPLETE. Deterministic: across 4 runs
sub_8210AF90_RAN=0, dispatch_REACHED=0, sub_8211BE68_RET=0 (the earlier "returned by 28s" was a buggy awk
filter, not a real return). ⇒ **UNIFIES the wall**: advance-gate (no transitions) ← sub_8211BE68's load blocks ←
loader doesn't complete ← GPU resource-create (textures) incomplete = the cont.21 A↔B root, now reached from the
advance-gate angle. The title can't enable screen transitions until sub_8211BE68's load finishes, which needs the
loader to complete, which needs the GPU resource created. NEXT (R2 cont.): trace what sub_8211BE68→sub_822487C8
is loading + what its completion waits on (the specific resource + its GPU-create / fence dependency) — the same
loader/GPU-create wall, now with a concrete entry point (sub_8211BE68/sub_822487C8). New hooks under REX_ADVGATE.
Default boot unaffected. Commits pending (NOT pushed).

**cont.25 /loop R2 — ⭐ BREAKTHROUGH: sub_8211BE68 IS the advance gate; forcing it to skip ADVANCES the title.**
sub_822487C8/sub_82448158/sub_8244FE80 are short non-looping memcpy-chain fns ⇒ the non-terminating loop is in
sub_8211BE68's indirect target (a "process-all-resources" driver looping until the loader reports done, which
never happens). TEST (REX_FORCEBE68: skip sub_8211BE68 only when called from sub_8211B740@0x8211B894, return
success): the title **ADVANCES from the stuck intro** — loads **72 assets (vs 65)**: NEW = `Levels.xmc`,
`Campaigns.xmc`, `Challenges.xmc` (the level-select/menu data!), `ParticleTextures.bin`, `SouthPark.par`
(particles), `Projectiles.bin`, `structuretextures.bin` (gameplay). ⇒ **sub_8211BE68's blocking load was THE
gate, and the advance machinery WORKS downstream** (the title progresses to menu/level-select + gameplay
preload). ⚠ but: (a) the EXECUTED render (REX_EXECSEGS device+13568 segments) is UNCHANGED — still the intro-built
placeholder draws (prim5/13/4 tex=0x0, prim8 empty-EDRAM); the new menu/gameplay render content isn't in those
segments (it's built later / elsewhere). (b) skipping is too BLUNT — it skips a real resource-load, leaving a
null ⇒ next blocker = INDIRECT-NULL at **sub_82292D08** (targets 0x0 / 0x8181FFF8), intermittent crash. ⇒ the
PROPER fix is to make sub_8211BE68's load COMPLETE (the loader/GPU-create completion) rather than skip it; the
skip is a powerful DIAGNOSTIC proving the gate + that the title can advance. NEXT: push past sub_82292D08 (is it
another handleable null?) to see how far the title gets / whether it renders the menu; and/or make sub_8211BE68's
load terminate properly. New gated diag `REX_FORCEBE68`. Default boot unaffected. Commits pending (NOT pushed).

**cont.25 /loop R2 — the advance gate's non-terminating loop PINPOINTED.** Clean full backtrace of the stuck
thread (tid=10): `GuestThreadRun→CallGuest(sub_82450FD0)→sub_82250420[work-loop]→sub_8211B740[transitions
handler]→sub_8211BE68→sub_8224F890→sub_8224F918[the loader RE-QUEUER]→sub_82247E70→sub_822490D0→sub_82249338`.
**The non-terminating loop is sub_82247E70** (94-line fn): `loc_82247ECC: …sub_822490D0…sub_82249338…
if(r3!=0) goto loc_82247ECC` — it loops processing the loader work-queue (sub_822490D0 + the 279-line item
state-machine sub_82249338, switch on item-state r5∈{1,3,5,…}) while sub_82249338 returns non-zero (more/pending
items). It NEVER exits because the items never COMPLETE — they're re-queued via **sub_8224F918** (the re-queuer,
matching the earlier loader finding) since they need a GPU resource-create that variant A never does. ⇒ the
advance gate (sub_8211BE68 won't return → sub_8210AF90 transitions-enable never fires) IS the loader work-loop
sub_82247E70 spinning forever on GPU-pending items. This UNIFIES with R0/R1 (loader file-read works; the GPU
texture create/completion is the wall) — the advance is gated on the same GPU-create, now with the EXACT spin
loop (sub_82247E70) + per-item state machine (sub_82249338) + re-queuer (sub_8224F918) localized. CLEAN-FIX
options (vs the blunt REX_FORCEBE68 skip that leaves nulls): (a) make items complete (model the GPU-create
completion sub_82249338's states wait on) → loop drains naturally; (b) break the infinite RE-QUEUE (limit
sub_8224F918 once the real burst is processed) so the work-loop drains the current queue + exits, letting
sub_8211BE68 do its real work then return cleanly (cleaner than skipping it). NEXT: test (b) — cap the loop /
limit re-queue, run + REX_EXECSEGS, check for a STABLE advance (no nulls/crash) + whether new render content
appears. No code change this iter (RE + bt only). Commits pending (NOT pushed).

**cont.25 /loop R2 — NO SHORTCUT to a clean advance (definitive).** sub_8224F918 (the loader driver) sets up a
child (stores state+136/src+160/size+168) + calls sub_82247E70 (the spin loop) and sub_822481E0 (the R0 worker
poll `while(*(child+136)∉{1,12})`). Tested two completion PROXIES to drain the loop without the blunt skip:
(1) **REX_LOADERLATCH** (hold child[0] at state 1) — latch FIRES (`[ldtrace] state 3->1 [latched]`) but the title
does NOT advance (65 assets) ⇒ the work-loop's re-queue isn't gated on child[0]'s state. (2) **REX_CPDRAIN**
(drain the pending-GPU-work counter device+0x2b04 FULLY to 0 each vblank, vs CPCOMPLETE's −1) — also does NOT
advance (65 assets) ⇒ not gated on that counter either (note: atlas 0xA5004800 got a tiny 0x00000002 header under
CPDRAIN, still no pixels). ⇒ **the loop's re-queue is gated on a REAL resource-completion that no simple proxy
(state-latch, counter-drain, and per cont.22 fence-forward/force-state) satisfies — only the actual GPU resource-
create.** DEFINITIVE (every shortcut exhausted): the clean advance needs the deep GPU-resource-create build; only
the BLUNT REX_FORCEBE68 skip "advances" (skipping the loop, leaving nulls). ⇒ /loop has reached the structural
limit the plan predicted ("poor /loop fit"): breakthrough ACHIEVED (title CAN advance; sub_8211BE68 is the gate)
+ the wall EXHAUSTIVELY mapped (textures R0/R1 + advance gate all converge on the GPU-resource-create completion).
Remaining = that deep multi-session build (model the per-item create-completion the loader checks — RE
sub_822490D0's done-vs-requeue condition + the GPU resource it represents). New gated diags REX_CPDRAIN,
REX_ITEMSPIN, REX_LOADERLATCH. Default boot unaffected. Commits pending (NOT pushed).

**cont.25 /loop — no VISIBLE-result shortcut either; /loop PAUSED at the breakthrough milestone.** Confirmed the
force-skip yields no new rendered content: with REX_FORCEBE68+REX_EXECSEGS the executed device+13568 segments are
STILL the intro placeholders ([esdraw] prim5/4/13/8, same as baseline) — the title advances its LOADING (level/
gameplay data) but the new menu/gameplay render content needs it to fully reach the render state (gated on the
GPU-create). ⇒ every shortcut is exhausted: clean advance (latch/counter-drain/fence-forward — all fail), and
visible result (force-skip — loading only, no new render). **/loop has delivered its value for this build and
reached the structural limit the plan predicted.** Achieved this session (cont.25, commits d636ec0→21a9cf9, NOT
pushed): (1) RE-GROUNDED the wall (loader file-read + frontend completion-drain WORK; the docs' "stuck loader"
was a worker-poll artifact); (2) characterized the renderer wall (3 empty texture sources; texture DATA partly
EXISTS — 14/35 bound textures populated); (3) ⭐ BREAKTHROUGH: identified the title's ADVANCE GATE = sub_8211BE68
(the loader work-loop sub_82247E70 spinning forever on GPU-pending items, re-queued via sub_8224F918), and PROVED
the title CAN advance — REX_FORCEBE68 skip → loads level-select (Levels/Campaigns/Challenges.xmc) + gameplay
(particles/projectiles/structures); (4) EXHAUSTIVELY confirmed no shortcut to a clean/visible result. **Remaining
= the deep multi-session GPU-resource-create subsystem** (Xenos tiled-texture decode + .xbv→SPIR-V + EDRAM RT +
real draw translation + per-item create-completion so the loader loop drains) — a deliberate go/no-go the plan
flags as the user's, best done in a FRESH focused session (not /loop, not this 11-iteration context). Entry
points all localized: sub_8211BE68 / sub_82247E70 / sub_822490D0 (done-vs-requeue) / sub_8224F918. Gated diags
retained: REX_ADVGATE / REX_FORCEBE68 / REX_ITEMSPIN / REX_LOADERLATCH / REX_CPDRAIN / REX_TEXWATCH / REX_TEXBIND.
Default boot unregressed throughout. ⭐TO RESUME: re-issue /loop (or a focused session) to start the deep
GPU-create build; entry = model the per-item create-completion sub_822490D0 checks, or build texture-decode first.

**cont.25 — ⚠ RIGOR CORRECTION + texture-decode BLOCKED.** Extended REX_TEXBIND to log the bound textures' full
fetch constant (dims from d2, format from d1[5:0], type/tiled from d0). MEASURED: the "populated" bound textures
have **IMPLAUSIBLE fetch constants** — dims like 6277×2033 / 41×6129 / 4093×2166, type bits=1 (not 2 for a 2D
texture), random d0/d2. ⇒ INFERRED (rigor): either R1's "14/35 populated textures, bind path works" was a
MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT (noise in the 0x4800 fetch region whose d1 coincidentally masks to a 0x04-0x06 base + the
block happens to hold data), OR my fetch-constant decode layout is wrong — EITHER WAY I cannot extract a clean
real texture (valid dims/format) to decode. ⚠ So R1's "bind path works / texture DATA partly exists" claim is in
DOUBT (only the EDRAM bind 0xB0000000=0x10000000 base was clean). This BLOCKS the texture-decode-first approach
(no clean texture to decode) and reconfirms the textures genuinely aren't created. ⇒ the foundation must be the
CREATE (produce real textures), not the decode — and the create is the inlined-D3D/CPU-tile that doesn't run
(intractable via interception). I've now hit a wall on EVERY foundational sub-piece (completion-proxy, loop-cap,
force-skip-render, texture-decode) — the deep build genuinely needs a sustained from-scratch GPU-subsystem
implementation, not incremental probing. The breakthrough (force-skip advances the title's LOADING; sub_8211BE68
is the gate) stands. New: REX_TEXBIND logs full fetch constant. Default boot unregressed. Commits NOT pushed.

## cont.26 (2026-06-05, /loop "работай дальше автономно") — ⭐ CORRECTS cont.25: the spin loop sub_82247E70 does NOT hang; the real advance-gate wall is a RUNAWAY null-source deserialize in sub_82110728

Fresh /loop, autonomous. Executed the cont.25-recommended de-risk (decode the advance-gate loop's done-vs-requeue
gate) via static decode + 4 new gated diags. **Default boot UNREGRESSED — verified:** exit124, 110,815 progress
lines, only the 2 pre-existing baseline INDIRECT-NULL, 0 leakage of the new tags. Diags: REX_LOOPTRACE,
REX_BE68INNER, REX_728INNER, REX_728CAP (all getenv-gated, default-off). Commits cont.26 (NOT pushed). Run-base
`REX_NOTOKEN=1 REX_CSLEAK=1 REX_CPCOMPLETE=1 REX_MOVIE_EOF=30`.

**Static decode (sub_82247E70 / sub_822490D0 / sub_82249338).** sub_82247E70 walks a global heap (0x828F9A78)
via sub_822490D0 (get-first) + sub_82249338 (per-item heap op; switch on r5 = the PREVIOUS item's vtable[1]
return). Decoded sub_82249338's switch: **r5=2 decrements the heap count = removes/COMPLETES an item**; r5=0 =
advance cursor (keep); r5=3 = re-sift (re-queue). The done-vs-requeue decision is the per-item vtable[1] return.

**REX_ITEMSPIN (enriched with vtable[1] target + item state +4).** Item codes are only {0,3}, NEVER 2 — so at
first this matched cont.25's "re-queued, never complete". BUT at steady state the items' +4 state PROGRESSES
0→1→2 and the heaps DRAIN (ret=0); the spin-loop heap 0x828F9A78 is mostly EMPTY (ret=0). The one item stuck at
state 0 (0x828E8430) has vtable[1]=sub_821B4F88 = trivial `return 0` (a sentinel, not the gate).

**⭐ REX_LOOPTRACE — the decisive correction.** Wrapped sub_82247E70 ENTER/RET: ALL 50 calls RETURN (loop drains
every time, lr=0x8224F93C from sub_8224F918). **sub_82247E70 is NOT the infinite loop.** Yet AdvLog shows
sub_8211BE68 ENTERs and NEVER RETs. ⇒ cont.25's "sub_8211BE68 never returns BECAUSE sub_82247E70 spins forever"
is MEASURABLY WRONG. The bt cont.25 cited (sub_8211BE68→sub_8224F890→…→sub_82247E70) was a TRANSIENT snapshot.

**⭐ REX_BE68INNER — localized the real hang.** sub_8211BE68 is LINEAR (no loop): indirect poll → sub_8224F890 →
sub_82250110 → sub_82110728 → sub_822501C8 → final vtable. Filtered ENTER/RET on its own call-sites:
sub_8224F890@0x8211BEB0 RET, sub_82250110@0x8211BEC4 RET, **sub_82110728@0x8211BECC ENTER, NO RET = THE WALL.**

**⭐⭐ REX_728INNER — root cause.** sub_82110728 is a counted loop `r28 = sub_8224FDB0(stream); while(r28){ …
sub_82110B18; if(0){sub_821B1310; sub_8212E830;} sub_82250090 }`. sub_8224FDB0 deserializes a 4-byte count from
a stream (4× vtable[0] byte-reads). Measured count = **0x60606060** (filler) → ~1.6 BILLION iters = the "hang"
(reproducible 3/3 runs that reach it; inner calls get garbage args 0xFFFFFFFF/0x60606060). Stream-object dump
(0x9825F860): vtable=0x820E42D4 ✓, **+20 (source) = 0x00000000 = NULL**, +1C = the job 0x9825F640 (holds
0x10010001 = SQ_PROGRAM_CNTL ⇒ a SHADER/render resource). sub_82250110 builds the stream with source = r4 =
*(stack+96) = NULL and a fresh uninit 10240-byte (0x2800) read buffer at +88. Null source ⇒ deserialize reads
filler ⇒ runaway. (Race: the same path sometimes hits INDIRECT-NULL vtable→0xC0006000 instead of hanging.)

**WHY the source is null (traced).** sub_8224F890→sub_8224F918 sets the output buffer (*(output+16)) ONLY if
sub_82247E70 returns non-null; it returns 0 (the resource is not in the global heap 0x828F9A78 in a ready state)
⇒ the buffer stays null ⇒ null-source stream ⇒ runaway. So the shader resource 0x9825F640 genuinely isn't loaded.

**⭐ REX_728CAP — the tractability test (surgical, vs the blunt FORCEBE68 skip-all).** Clamp the absurd count
(>0x10000)→0 so sub_82110728 runs 0 iters and RETURNS. RESULT: **sub_8211BE68 now RETURNS** (ENTER+RET — the gate
passes!) — but the title does NOT advance: only 65 assets (vs FORCEBE68's 72; NO Levels/Campaigns/Challenges.xmc),
transition byte 0x828E82A6 NOT set, +10 downstream INDIRECT-NULL. ⇒ unblocking the gate is NOT enough — the null
bypass leaves the title resource-less; it needs the REAL resource.

**⇒ DE-RISK VERDICT (corrects + sharpens cont.25).** The advance gate is NOT a GPU-fence wait — it's a runaway
null-source deserialize (sub_82110728) of an UNLOADED shader/render resource (0x9825F640). The gate CAN be
surgically passed (clamp) but that does NOT advance the title (resource still missing). Root = sub_8224F890 →
sub_82247E70 returns null because resource 0x9825F640 isn't ready in the loader heap. **⭐ NEXT (next /loop):** is
0x9825F640's shader data — the ~19 .xbv shader files ARE read from disk early per the asset map — supposed to be
wired into this resource's stream source (a **TRACTABLE loader-plumbing bug**), or produced by a GPU op (deep
build)? This is the FIRST evidence the gate might be tractable. Entry points: sub_8224F890 (resource fetch),
sub_82247E70 (returns null), the global heap 0x828F9A78, and whatever should populate *(output+16) for shaders.
Default boot unregressed throughout.

## cont.27 (2026-06-05, /loop "работай дальше автономно") — ⭐ advance-gate resource IDENTIFIED = Meshes\Global.bin; prod loads it, variant A doesn't (strace prod-oracle, no gdb)

Continued cont.26's open question (tractable vs deep). New gated diag REX_RESID (default boot unregressed). Used
**strace on the PROD binary as the oracle** — sidesteps the gdb-SIGSEGV-paging problem entirely (same file-open
syscalls). Commit cont.27 (NOT pushed).

**Resource IDENTIFIED (REX_RESID dumps the stuck sub_8211BE68 call's job arg + the static descriptors as
hex/ASCII).** job r3 = 0x820D2844 = the path string **"Assets\Global\Meshes\Global.bin"** — a global MESH
resource (NOT a shader; cont.26's SQ_PROGRAM_CNTL came from a different field). In sub_8211B740 (the transition
handler, ppc_recomp.3.cpp:11227) the path is loaded into r3 (`addi r3,r11,10308`) then sub_8211BE68(r3=path) is
called directly — exactly ONCE (Textures\Global.bin is loaded by a different path). So sub_8211BE68(path) is the
fetch of Meshes\Global.bin.

**sub_8211BE68's flow has NO file-open** — it's a pure FETCH expecting the resource pre-loaded: sub_8224F890
(sub_82248AF8 = name-lookup in the registry; sub_8224F918→sub_82247E70 = lookup-by-path → NULL) then sub_82249C08
(a "not-ready" WARNING/callback, NOT a loader: it calls sub_8244E4D0 with a string + a stored callback *(obj+12),
no open) → null buffer → sub_82250110 null-source stream → sub_82110728 runaway (cont.26). So a SEPARATE
global-asset loader must open+register Meshes\Global.bin before the transition runs.

**⭐ PROD-ORACLE (strace -f -tt -e trace=openat on south_park_td, 40s).** Prod opens **Meshes/Global.bin at
20:37:52.729, immediately after Textures/Global.bin (.571)**, then a full batch: StructureGeom.bin, WallsGeom.bin,
CharacterGeom.bin, ParticleTextures.bin, Projectiles.bin, Structures.bin… (107 distinct assets; reaches the menu).
**Variant A opens Textures/Global.bin (#64) then STOPS at 65 assets — never opens Meshes/Global.bin.** (These are
exactly the assets REX_FORCEBE68 unlocked.) So the global-asset loader loads a SEQUENCE (Textures\Global.bin →
Meshes\Global.bin → gameplay meshes/textures); variant A's halts right after Textures\Global.bin.

**⇒ REFRAME (corrects cont.25's "GPU resource create" framing).** The advance gate needs **Meshes\Global.bin —
a MESH = CPU vertex/index data, loaded by plain file I/O that variant A implements faithfully** — NOT a GPU
texture/EDRAM create. tid=10's bt is stuck in sub_8211BE68's deserialize runaway (NOT in a texture create) ⇒ NOT
blocked on GPU. **Strongest evidence yet that the gate is TRACTABLE** (a loader-sequence/ordering divergence around
a CPU mesh asset). ⚠ Honest open Q (rigor — NOT yet pinned): WHY does variant A's global-asset loader stop after
Textures\Global.bin? Could be a loader bug/ordering (tractable) or a real sub-gate. ⭐ NEXT /loop: find the
global-asset loader (what opens Textures\Global.bin and should continue to Meshes\Global.bin) and its stop
condition — instrument the NtCreateFile caller chain / find the manifest-driven loader; the prod strace
(/tmp/prod_strace.log) gives the exact asset order to match. Default boot unregressed. New tool: REX_RESID.

## cont.28 (2026-06-05, /loop) — ⭐⭐⭐ BREAKTHROUGH: the advance-gate wall is a TRACTABLE frame-corruption bug in the recompiled poll sub_822487C8; skipping it ADVANCES the title (65→94 assets: level-select + gameplay + attract movie)

Continued cont.27. **CRACKED the wall.** New gated diags (default boot UNREGRESSED — exit124, 110.7k lines, 65
assets, 2 baseline crashes, 0 leakage): REX_OPENER, REX_FIXPATH, REX_SKIPPOLL + extended REX_RESID/REX_LOOPTRACE.
Commit cont.28 (NOT pushed).

**The loader IS the work-loop (REX_OPENER — guest caller chain at NtCreateFile).** Textures/Global.bin's open
chain = NtCreateFile ← 0x82447FFC ← sub_822483xx ← sub_82247F10 ← **sub_82247E70's vtable[1] @0x82247EE8** ←
sub_8224F918 ← sub_8224F890. So the file open happens INSIDE sub_82247E70's per-item vtable[1] — the work-loop
opens a file when it finds a matching registry item. For Textures an item exists (opens); for Meshes sub_82247E70
returns null (no item → no open → hang).

**Asset diff (prod strace vs variant A): variant A loads frontend assets but NONE of the gameplay/mesh/level
assets** (all Meshes/*, gameplay .bin, Levels/Campaigns/Challenges.xmc, gameplay textures) = the menu→gameplay
boundary, gated by the transition hang.

**RIGOR — CONFIRMED the hang = the Meshes load (be68call logs every sub_8211BE68 (lr,r3)).** Exactly ONE call:
#0 lr=0x8211B894 (sub_8211B740) r3=0x820D2844 'Assets\Global\Meshes\Global.bin', ENTER no RET. (cont.26's
0xFFFFFFFF was r31 AFTER corruption, not the arg — cont.27's resource ID stands.)

**⭐ ROOT CAUSE: r31 (the path) is CORRUPTED to 0xFFFFFFFF across the vtable[11] poll sub_822487C8.** The recomp
(ppc_recomp.3.cpp:12119-12141) sets r31=r3=path at entry; the only thing before `r4=r31; sub_8224F890` is the
poll bctrl @0x8211BE98. Measured (SAME invocation): sub_8211BE68 r3=path, sub_8224F890 r4=0xFFFFFFFF. Poll target
= sub_822487C8 (pollobj 0x826574E8, vt 0x820DAE34). sub_822487C8 itself doesn't touch r31 (it calls vtable[10] +
sub_82448158 → the memcpy chain sub_8244FE80/sub_8242BF10 per cont.25 bt), so a CALLEE corrupts the frame.

**The corruption is BROADER than r31.** REX_FIXPATH (restore sub_8224F890's r4 to the real path) did NOT unblock —
sub_82247E70 still never gets the Meshes path. So sub_8224F890 diverges before sub_8224F918 on other corrupted
frame state, not just r31.

**⭐⭐⭐ REX_SKIPPOLL (skip sub_822487C8's body only from the 0x8211BE98 site, return 1 = the same nonzero it
returned anyway) → THE TITLE ADVANCES.** sub_8211BE68 #0 RETURNS; Meshes\Global.bin OPENS (asset #65);
sub_82247E70('...Meshes\Global.bin') → FOUND; the loader CONTINUES: StructureGeom/WallsGeom/CharacterGeom/
EnemyGeom, **Levels/Campaigns/Challenges.xmc (level-select!)**, Projectiles/Structures/characterDefs/EnemyTypes/
pickups/MeshEntities/Rat (.spm mesh + .dds texture), hudimages, and the **attract movie
towerDefense_attract_movie.wmv** — **65→94 assets, exit124 (full 35s), only 1 INDIRECT-NULL (< baseline's 2)**.
sub_8211BE68 #1–#4 also load meshes and RET. ⇒ the poll returned the right value (nonzero) but its SIDE EFFECT
(frame corruption) was the blocker; removing the side effect fixes it.

**⇒ CRACKS cont.25's "deep multi-session GPU build".** The advance-gate wall was a TRACTABLE recompiled-code
frame-corruption bug in sub_822487C8's callee chain (a CPU mesh-resource poll), NOT a GPU dependency — the FIRST
TARGETED (non-blunt-FORCEBE68) advance past the menu→gameplay boundary. ⭐ NEXT: (1) the PROPER fix — pin the
exact corrupting callee (vtable[10] of 0x826574E8 / sub_82448158 / sub_8244FE80 / the memcpy sub_8242BF10 — likely
an oversized memcpy; cont.25 noted size=numI*16, cont.26 saw 0x60606060 garbage counts) and fix the recomp/runtime
to replace the REX_SKIPPOLL workaround; (2) push the advance further toward a rendered menu (combine with the
renderer/REX_EXECSEGS). REX_SKIPPOLL is a clean gated workaround that demonstrably advances the title. Default
boot unregressed.

## cont.29 (2026-06-05, /loop) — ⭐ ROOT CAUSE PINNED: the poll's stack-shredding memcpy = size *(obj+60)=0xFFFFFFFF; REX_CLAMPCPY (surgical) preserves r31 + advances the title

Continued cont.28 (the proper fix). PINNED the corruption to the exact memcpy + a surgical fix. New gated diags
REX_R31TRACK, REX_CLAMPCPY (default boot unregressed — exit124, 65 assets, 0 leakage). Commit cont.29 (NOT pushed).

**Localized the corruptor (REX_R31TRACK — set g_inPoll across the poll, log r31 in/out of each callee).** The poll
sub_822487C8 ENTER r31=0x820D2844 (path) → EXIT r31=0xFFFFFFFF (CORRUPTED). The callee that flips it: **sub_82448158**
(r31 0x820D2844→0xFFFFFFFF). sub_82448158 DOES save/restore r31 (std r31,-16(r1) … ld r31,-16(r1)), so its saved
slot is OVERWRITTEN during execution — a stack-memory corruption, not a missing save.

**⭐ THE BUG (REX_R31TRACK logs every in-poll memcpy dest/src/size): the poll's first memcpy is
`sub_8242BF10(dest=0x9825F6CC, src=0x9825F430, size=0xFFFFFFFF)`** — a 4GB stack-to-stack copy that shreds
sub_82448158's saved-r31 slot (and the frame). In sub_8244FE80 (ppc_recomp.65.cpp, the memcpy's caller) the size
is `r5 = *(r31 + 60)` — **the size is read from object field +60, which holds 0xFFFFFFFF (uninitialized/garbage; a
-1 sentinel mis-used as a length).** Same class as cont.26's 0x60606060 garbage count: an unready/uninitialized
resource object drives a wild-size copy.

**⭐⭐ REX_CLAMPCPY (zero the in-poll memcpy when size>=0x100000): r31 is PRESERVED (poll ENTER/EXIT both 0x820D2844)
and the title ADVANCES** — Meshes\Global.bin opens, 65→94 assets (level-select + gameplay + attract movie), 1
INDIRECT-NULL. Two independent fixes (cont.28 REX_SKIPPOLL, cont.29 REX_CLAMPCPY) now confirm the root cause;
CLAMPCPY is the more SURGICAL (it neutralizes only the garbage copy, keeping the rest of the poll's real work).

**⇒ ROOT CAUSE = a wild-size memcpy (size from an uninitialized object field +60 = 0xFFFFFFFF) shredding the
stack across the resource poll.** A tractable data/recomp bug, NOT a GPU dependency (confirms cont.28). ⭐ NEXT:
(1) the FULLY-proper fix — RE why object+60 is 0xFFFFFFFF (which object, why uninitialized at poll time — same
loader-state thread as cont.26's 0x60606060); decide whether to promote REX_CLAMPCPY to a default-on guard
(it cleanly advances the title and default boot is safe) vs fixing the upstream init; (2) push the advance toward
a rendered menu (combine CLAMPCPY/SKIPPOLL with the renderer). ⚠ honest: the default-boot INDIRECT-NULL guard-fire
count is high-variance (pre-existing intermittent race, non-fatal — exit124/65 assets invariant); my default-boot
changes are gated no-ops. Diags REX_R31TRACK/REX_CLAMPCPY. Default boot unregressed.

## cont.30 (2026-06-05/06, /loop autonomous) — ⭐ CLAMPCPY promoted to DEFAULT-ON (advance is now the default boot) + transitions ENABLE + render is a measured null-result; ⚠ a REX_RENDER bg run hung 6h (process-hygiene fix)

Continued cont.29 (the two NEXT branches: proper fix / promote default-on + push the advance toward a render).
Commit cont.30 (NOT pushed). Default boot now ADVANCES (65→~96 assets) and is exit-124 clean.

**Reproduced the cont.29 baseline (the test harness).** Default boot (un-clamped) = 65 assets, then the poll's
4GB memcpy runs and the title hangs/crashes (one of my un-clamped runs SIGSEGV'd at exit 139 — the 4GB copy IS
the crash, not just a hang). REX_CLAMPCPY=1 = 96 assets, exit 124 clean. The [r31] trace pinned the exact killer:
`memcpy dest=0x9825F6CC src=0x9825F430 size=0xFFFFFFFF` (poll ENTER r31=0x820D2844 path → EXIT preserved when
clamped). Note: the run log carries NUL bytes (core/binary writes) — analyze with `grep -a`.

**RE: why obj+60 = 0xFFFFFFFF (proper-fix characterization, task #2).** Traced the copy chain statically:
- **sub_82448158 = lookup-and-copy** (ppc_recomp.64.cpp:17385): `RtlInitAnsiString(name)` → build a key
  `{-3, &ansi, 64}` → **sub_8244FF20(key, dstBuf=stack+112, 328, &result)** = the lookup; `if (r3 < 0)` →
  cleanup + return -1 (NO copy); `else` → **sub_8244FE80(src=stack+112, dst=r31)** = the copy.
- **sub_8244FF20** (ppc_recomp.65.cpp:20244) = **NtOpenFile + an indirect read** of the resource record into the
  328-byte buffer. (Uses NtOpenFile, not NtCreateFile — so this open is NOT in the [asset]/NtCreateFile trace.)
- **sub_8244FE80** (ppc_recomp.65.cpp:20155) copies the record header (fields 56,8,12,…→dst) then
  `memcpy(dst+44, src+64, *(src+60))` + null-terminates — i.e. **+60 is the inline-blob length, +64 the blob.**
- ⭐ **Rigor (no rebuild needed): the killer memcpy EXECUTED ⇒ sub_82448158 took its `bge` success branch ⇒
  sub_8244FF20 returned ≥ 0 (found/read OK).** So the record is "found" but its length field +60 = 0xFFFFFFFF
  (the -1 "size unknown / streaming-not-ready" sentinel of the still-loading Meshes\Global.bin record). **NOT a
  branch mis-emit** — the same not-ready-resource class as cont.26 (0x60606060 count) and cont.27 (registered-
  but-unloaded). The fully-upstream fix (populate +60 mid-stream) IS the deep streaming-loader build — out of
  scope and unnecessary; the in-scope correct fix is a guard.

**DECISION (task #3): promoted CLAMPCPY to a DEFAULT-ON guard.** kernel.cpp: `g_inPoll` made `thread_local`
(set only across the tid=10 transition poll → safe vs a concurrent large memcpy on another thread); the guard
fires by default (env `REX_NOCLAMPCPY` opts out) when an in-poll memcpy size ≥ 256MB (the poll's legit copies
are ≤0x3C; threshold widened 1MB→256MB for default-on safety, behaviorally identical for the 0xFFFFFFFF
sentinel). **Verified (3 stable runs): new default boot = 96 assets, exit 124 clean, the 4GB-memcpy crash
ELIMINATED, 1 pre-existing non-fatal INDIRECT-NULL; REX_NOCLAMPCPY restores 65.** A strict improvement: removes
a crash AND advances the title past the menu→gameplay gate by default.

**⭐ NEW MILESTONE: the transition machinery now COMPLETES.** With the gate cleared (sub_8211BE68 now returns),
REX_INITDIAG shows: `sub_82250420 worker ENTERED` → `sub_8211B740 work-handler ran` →
**`*** sub_8210AF90 RAN — 0x828E82A6 set, transitions enabled ***`**. This is exactly the cont.25 prediction:
the advance machinery works once the gate passes. The asset trace then enters the **main-menu ATTRACT LOOP** —
Rat MeshEntity (Rat_Mesh1.spm + rat.dds) + **hudimages.bin**, then cycling sp_xbox_0_intro.wmv ↔
towerDefense_attract_movie.wmv (assets #92-95). The title is no longer stuck; it runs the attract sequence.

**📐 RENDER = MEASURED NULL-RESULT (task #4).** Ran `REX_RENDER=1 REX_MENUTEST=1 REX_MENUTEX=1 REX_EXECSEGS=3`
WITH the advance default-on. It rendered + captured /tmp/varianta_menu.ppm (frame 531) = **the SAME backdrop as
cont.24** (24 verts = 4 LevelSelectBG quadrants; mean RGB 82,114,118 vs cont.24's 82,113,117). The [ldframe]
sample stayed atlas 0xA5004800=0 / edram 0xB0000000=0 / all per-draw tex slots empty. **⇒ the advance does NOT
enrich the rendered scene — the executed device+13568 draw segments are still the sparse backdrop; the renderer
wall (loader-gated per-draw textures, cont.24) is INDEPENDENT of the advance gate. Two separate walls.** The
rich/readable menu still needs the deep renderer build (per-draw texture decode/upload + a loader that populates
non-empty per-draw textures), OR reaching the actual level-select SCREEN (not the idle attract loop) via input
injection so the title builds a NEW draw scene into device+13568.

**⚠ PROCESS HAZARD found (and the cause of a 6-hour hang).** REX_RENDER runs IGNORE `timeout`'s SIGTERM — the
detached render thread keeps spinning (vkQueuePresent loop) at ~101% CPU, so `timeout 45` (which only sends
SIGTERM, no -k escalation) waited forever and the background task never completed. I idled waiting for a
completion signal that never came → the GUI window spun ~6h (log reached vblank 1.6M / "menu-quad test frame
1560300") until the user told me to kill it. Killed via `pkill -9`. **Lesson (durable): for any REX_RENDER run
use `timeout -s KILL -k 5 N` (force SIGKILL), and NEVER launch a GUI run as a background task and then idle on
its completion — bound it and poll, or run it foreground with a hard SIGKILL timeout.** The non-render runs
(exit 124) respond to SIGTERM fine; only REX_RENDER is affected.

**⇒ NET cont.30:** the advance gate fix is now DEFAULT-ON (a real, durable milestone — title advances 65→96
assets, transitions enable, enters attract loop, crash removed), and the render path is rigorously confirmed to
be a SEPARATE wall the advance doesn't move. NEXT: (a) input-injection (REX_SKIPINTRO START+A) to push past the
attract loop toward a real level-select SCREEN, then re-check if EXECSEGS gets new draw content to render; OR
(b) the deep renderer build (per-draw texture decode/upload). Diags: CLAMPCPY now default-on + REX_NOCLAMPCPY,
REX_R31TRACK retained. Default boot now = 96-asset advance (the old 65-asset boot is `REX_NOCLAMPCPY=1`).

**cont.30 addendum — the cont.31 lead (measured, not yet fixed).** Ran the advance default-on + REX_SKIPINTRO
(injects A+START): instead of the idle attract movie loop, the title loads **88 distinct GAMEPLAY assets** —
Characters\MovenFireData.xmc, enemytextures/EnemyGeom/EnemyTypes, pickuptextures/pickupGeom/pickups, the Rat
enemy mesh+texture, hudimages.bin — i.e. it tries to load INTO a level. Then it STALLS at a NEW gate: an
**`[INDIRECT-NULL] target=0xFFFFFFFF (caller lr=0x8215DE84)`** — the menu-setup function (sub_8215DE.. in
ppc_recomp.7.cpp; cont.7 identified sub_8215DE84 as menu-setup) calls **sub_824253C8** (lr=0x8215DE84), inside
which an indirect call (bctrl) goes through a 0xFFFFFFFF function pointer. **Same -1/sentinel class as cont.30's
+60, but a DIFFERENT resource/fn-pointer (a new gate, not the same guard).** ⇒ cont.31 = RE this menu-setup
INDIRECT-NULL: which object's vtable/fn-pointer is 0xFFFFFFFF (an unready resource), and whether a targeted
guard/init advances the title further toward a real level/menu SCREEN (then re-check EXECSEGS for new draw
content). Entry: sub_8215DE84 / sub_824253C8 (ppc_recomp.7.cpp:16280) + whatever object holds the indirectly-
called fn-pointer. (2 INDIRECT-NULL this run, both at lr=0x8215DE84; the rest is the KeGetCurrentProcessType
stall-spin, atlas/edram still empty.)

## cont.31 (2026-06-06, /loop autonomous) — ⭐⭐ same-class guard on the menu-setup handler advances the title to LOADING LEVEL 1 (Stan's House) — 92 → 162 assets

Pursued the cont.30 addendum lead (the menu-setup INDIRECT-NULL). Same sentinel class, a clean targeted fix,
and it advances the title MUCH further — into actual level loading. Gated diag REX_HANDLERGUARD. Commit cont.31.

**The gate (RE).** sub_824253C8 (ppc_recomp.59.cpp:21119) is a **global-handler dispatch**: it reads a fn-pointer
at *(0x828183A0), guards ONLY `r10==0` (→ return error 0x80004001), then `bctr` to the pointer. When the handler
is **unregistered the global holds 0xFFFFFFFF** (the -1 sentinel — same class as cont.30's record+60), which
passes the ==0 check → `bctr` to 0xFFFFFFFF → INDIRECT-NULL at the menu-setup caller (sub_8215DE84,
ppc_recomp.7.cpp:16280). The generic INDIRECT-NULL guard skips the call but leaves r3=1 (a FALSE success, since
r3=1 was set before the bctr), so sub_8215DE84's `if (r3<0)` check (ppc_recomp.7:16283) is not taken → it
proceeds on bad state and stalls.

**The fix (REX_HANDLERGUARD).** Treat the 0xFFFFFFFF sentinel like null → return the proper error 0x80004001
(which IS <0 as int32) so the caller takes its "handler not ready" branch. (kernel.cpp PPC_FUNC(sub_824253C8),
global addr computed exactly as the recomp does.) Gated — it only matters once the handler is reached (i.e. with
REX_SKIPINTRO navigating past attract); default boot is untouched.

**⭐⭐ RESULT (REX_SKIPINTRO + REX_HANDLERGUARD + the default-on advance; reproducible, 2 runs IDENTICAL): 92 → 162
assets (118 distinct), the title LOADS LEVEL 1 — "Stan's House".** New content: all 4 character WaveBanks
(Cartman/Kenny/Kyle/Stan), the enemy AI LuaScripts (ManBearPig, Mongolian, Gnome, Homeless — the actual TD
enemies), mission/global/camera/audio/taunt/trigger scripts, **Stans_House.bin (the Level 1 map, referenced 8×)**,
and **Level1Intro.wmv**. The progression is now: 65 (stuck intro) → 96 (attract loop, cont.30) → **162 (Level 1
loading, cont.31)**. handlerguard fired 4× (the menu-setup re-dispatches). exit137 = clean SIGKILL at 42s.

**Next gate + honest limits.** The title then stalls at the NEXT gate: `[INDIRECT-NULL] target=0x00000000 (caller
lr=0x82292D08)` — a GENUINE null this time (not the -1 sentinel; sub_82292D08 is the cont.25-noted downstream
null). So the advance is a CHAIN of not-ready-resource gates, each the same uninitialized/sentinel class. ⚠ The
RENDERER is STILL the separate wall (atlas/edram empty all run) — loading Level 1 ≠ SEEING it; whether the level's
gameplay builds NEW renderable EXECSEGS draw content (vs the menu backdrop) is the open render question. NEXT
(cont.32): (a) the sub_82292D08 null gate (next in the chain); (b) whether chasing the gate chain reaches a
RENDERABLE state or just loads files (the renderer wall is independent — cont.30); (c) a CAREFUL render run
(timeout -s KILL) at the Level 1 state to check for new draw content. REX_HANDLERGUARD kept GATED (needs more
validation + only active with input) — not yet promoted to default-on.

**cont.32 check (same session) — render at Level 1 + the next gate's class.** (a) **Render check (careful, foreground,
`timeout -s KILL 40`, exit137 clean):** at the Level 1 load state (SKIPINTRO+HANDLERGUARD+REX_RENDER+EXECSEGS) the
capture = the SAME backdrop (mean RGB 82,114,118 = cont.24/30); [esdraw] shows the SAME frontend program — prim5
sprite / prim13 text (slot-0 still type 0/2 EMPTY) + prim8 backdrop (type-3 real verts). **⇒ loading Level 1 does
NOT change the rendered scene — the title loads L1 DATA while the frontend/loading screen is still the render
state; the renderer wall is confirmed INDEPENDENT of the loader advance even at the much-advanced L1 state (two
orthogonal walls, cont.30 holds).** (b) **Next gate sub_82292CE0 (ppc_recomp.36.cpp:25795, bctrl@0x82292D08):** a
VTABLE call `r3=*(global 0x8281D56C); (*r3)->vtable[1]()` with target=0x00000000 — a GENUINE null (an
uninitialized subsystem object), a DIFFERENT/HARDER class than the -1 sentinel guards (cont.30/31), and the
generic INDIRECT-NULL guard already skips it yet the title still stalls (skipping ≠ the method's effect). ⇒ **the
two easy same-class sentinel guards are DONE (great wins: title now loads Level 1); the remaining path is either
(i) the harder null-object-init gates or (ii) the deep renderer build (per-draw texture decode/upload + the
level's render program) — both lower /loop-fit, mirroring the cont.24/25 inflection.** This session's durable
deliverables: cont.30 (advance default-on, commit 4870841) + cont.31 (loads Level 1, commit b15d218). NEXT
(cont.33): RE sub_82292CE0's null object (which subsystem at 0x8281D56C, why uninit) — or the user steers toward
the renderer build.

## cont.33 (2026-06-06, /loop autonomous) — the post-Level-1 gate is a NULL (uncreated) gameplay subsystem, NOT a sentinel guard ⇒ confirms the deep-build inflection

RE'd the next gate after Level 1 loads. New gated diag REX_GATEDIAG (kept; default boot untouched). No commit of
a fix — the finding is that this gate is NOT a tractable guard.

**Corrected address + structure.** The base register is `lis -32128` = 0x82800000 (earlier note's 0x82820000 was
an arithmetic slip); subsystem struct base r31 = 0x82800000-10904 = **0x827FD568**, the object pointer = *(0x827FD56C).
sub_82292CE0 (caller 0x8215079C, the frontend range) reads `r3=*(0x827FD56C)`, calls `(*r3)->vtable[1]()`, then
loops over 4 sub-entries (r31+860, stride 36) doing cleanup (sub_8244E598/sub_82582F60/sub_82448B50).

**⭐ MEASURED (REX_GATEDIAG, with SKIPINTRO+HANDLERGUARD): the object is NULL — `*(0x827FD56C)=0x00000000`,
vtable=0, vtable[1]=0, struct+824=0** (the whole subsystem struct is zeroed). So this gate is NOT a -1 sentinel
(cont.30/31 class) — it is a **gameplay/transition subsystem that was NEVER CREATED**. The title loads Level 1
DATA (cont.31) but the subsystem that would PROCESS it isn't initialized.

**⇒ NOT a tractable guard.** The generic INDIRECT-NULL guard ALREADY tolerates the null vtable call (skips it),
yet the title still doesn't progress (stalls after Level 1, KeGetCurrentProcessType-spins) — so guarding harder
won't help; the fix requires the subsystem to be CREATED (or whatever gates its creation to run). Finding the
creation site statically is noisy (the global's offset -10904 appears at 100s of sites with different lis bases).
This is the deeper transition/subsystem-init work — consistent with cont.21's A↔B coupling and cont.32's
"renderer is the independent wall". **⇒ CONFIRMS the cont.32 inflection: the tractable sentinel-guard wins
(cont.30/31, which got the title to LOAD Level 1) are EXHAUSTED; the remaining path is the deep build (create the
gameplay subsystem / fix the frontend→gameplay transition / the renderer — all multi-session, poor /loop fit).**

**NEXT (cont.34, bounded):** characterize WHAT the post-Level-1 stall waits for — is the frontend update spinning
on (a) the Level1Intro.wmv cutscene (loaded #160; variant A has no VC-1 decoder, REX_MOVIE_EOF forces EOS — does
the Level-1 intro honor it?), (b) the uncreated gameplay subsystem, or (c) a render/GPU result (A↔B)? One diag
run to sample the main-thread state distinguishes them. If it's the deep build (likely), consolidate and hand off
for a focused renderer/transition session. Session deliverables stand: cont.30 (advance default-on) + cont.31
(loads Level 1). Gated diag REX_GATEDIAG retained for cont.34.

## cont.34 (2026-06-06, /loop autonomous) — the post-Level-1 stall is the GPU/render-COMPLETION wait (A↔B), not a CPU gate ⇒ the loader-path tractable wins are EXHAUSTED; /loop PAUSED at the Level-1 milestone

Located the actual post-Level-1 stall (the KeGetCurrentProcessType spin = 100k+ calls) with a new gated diag
REX_SPINTRACE (sample the guest caller LR; default boot no-op). Commit cont.34.

**MEASURED: the spin caller is in the GPU/render sync range.** Dominant lr=0x821C6F78 (inside sub_821C6F50) +
lr=0x821BFF64 + lr=0x821C0864 — all 0x821Bxxxx-0x821Cxxxx render code, called PER FRAME. sub_821C6F50 is a GPU op
(touches reg 0xC0003C00). So after loading Level 1 the title is in its **per-frame render loop waiting for GPU
completion**, exactly the cont.21 A↔B coupling / cont.22 fence-wait. The existing fence-forwards (sub_821C6E58,
sub_821C5DF0) advanced earlier waits but do NOT cover this post-Level-1 render-sync; and cont.32 already showed
REX_EXECSEGS at the L1 state renders only the FRONTEND program (the Level-1 render program isn't built — the
title won't build it until the GPU completes, which needs the renderer ⇒ the circular A↔B).

**⇒ ROBUST CONCLUSION: the post-Level-1 wall is the deep renderer/GPU-completion build, NOT a tractable CPU gate.**
This is QUALITATIVELY different from the cont.30/31 wins, which were CPU-side sentinel/null bugs in the LOADER
path (guardable). The loader path has now been taken to its end — the title LOADS Level 1 (cont.31) — and the
remaining wall is the RENDER path (GPU completion / the A↔B coupling), which is the genuine deep multi-session
renderer build (cont.21 PILLAR B / GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN), poor /loop fit (established cont.22/24/25 and now
reconfirmed from the gameplay side). The cont.33 null gameplay subsystem is downstream of this — it isn't created
because the title is blocked on the GPU sync first.

**⇒ /loop PAUSED at the Level-1 milestone (honest, rigorous — not the premature-pessimism of cont.24/25; this
time the loader path is genuinely exhausted and the wall is measured to be the render-completion coupling).**
Session wins (all committed, branch experimental/hle-graphics-spike, NOT pushed): cont.30 (4870841) advance
default-on, 65→96, crash removed, transitions enable; cont.31 (b15d218) loads Level 1 "Stan's House", 162 assets;
cont.32 (bf59a2f) renderer wall independent; cont.33 (f053fe0) post-L1 gate = null gameplay subsystem; cont.34
(this) the stall = GPU/render-completion A↔B. **TO RESUME: the deep renderer/GPU-completion build is a focused
session (the user has chosen this before) — execute device+13568 Level-1 render segments → real fence completion →
break the A↔B; or re-issue /loop to have me keep probing. Diags REX_GATEDIAG/REX_SPINTRACE retained.**

## cont.35 (2026-06-06, autonomous — "try to break the render wall") — ruled out the TRACTABLE L1-start angles (movie, hung fetch); the gate is genuinely the GPU-resource/subsystem-init layer (deep build)

User asked me to attack the render wall directly. Heeded my own meta-lesson (cont.25 wrongly called the MENU gate "deep / no shortcut" and cont.28-31 then cracked it tractably) and did NOT assume "deep build" — I tested the tractable mechanisms that cracked the menu gate. New gated diags REX_MOVIEPROBE/REX_MOVIE_EOF_ALL. Default boot unregressed (95 assets, clamp 4×, diags gated off).

**Ruled out — the Level-1 cutscene (Hypothesis A, FALSIFIED with measurement).** REX_MOVIEPROBE: at L1 TWO movie
players advance — the boot-intro-style player (g_moviePlayer, covered by REX_MOVIE_EOF) AND a second player
(~0x619AC60, ret=0x0, NOT covered). Suspected the Level1Intro.wmv cutscene was the gate. REX_MOVIE_EOF_ALL (force
EOS for ANY player) — **did NOT advance the title (still 162 assets).** ⇒ the cutscene is not the gate.

**Ruled out — a hung resource fetch (the mechanism that made the MENU gate tractable, cont.28-31).** REX_RESID
[be68call]: all SIX sub_8211BE68 calls at L1 RETURN (Global/structure/Walls/Character/Enemy/pickup geom — the
meshes fully load via the cont.30 CLAMPCPY). No ENTER-without-RET, no sentinel. ⇒ the L1-start gate is NOT a
hung fetch — qualitatively UNLIKE the menu gate. (sub_8211B740/sub_8210AF90 the menu-transition handlers run
exactly ONCE — that's what loaded L1; the L1-START uses a different mechanism.)

**The gate IS the GPU-resource/subsystem-init layer (measured, not assumed).** At L1: the loader (child[0]) is
IDLE (state 0, CPU data loaded), GPU texture/EDRAM memory is ZERO (atlasA5004800=0, edramB0000000=0, all per-draw
tex slots empty), and the title runs its per-frame RENDER LOOP fine (renders the frontend backdrop, cont.32) but
won't transition to L1. cont.33's gameplay subsystem manager (*(0x827FD568) struct, object at +4 = 0x827FD56C) is
ENTIRELY ZEROED — never initialized; its init is the L1-start transition, which is gated on the level's GPU
resources being created (textures decoded+uploaded — the cont.25 R0 keystone that NEVER RUNS). The object pointer
isn't written by any locatable direct-offset store; its construction is inside the level-start path that the GPU
completion gates. So this is the cont.21 A↔B coupling from the gameplay side: no L1 render program is built
(EXECSEGS at L1 = frontend only, cont.32) until the GPU completes, which needs the renderer.

**⇒ HONEST VERDICT: breaking the render wall genuinely requires the deep GPU-resource-creation build** — Xenos
tiled-texture decode + upload (system-mem → guest GPU texture block + fetch-const, the cont.25 R0 keystone) +
EDRAM render targets + executing the L1 render segments with REAL fence completion (cont.22) + the gameplay
subsystem init. The tractable force-shortcuts (movie EOS, hung-fetch guard, gate-skip) do NOT break it (gate-skip
crashes without resources — cont.25). This is the multi-session renderer (the spike's weeks estimate), NOT a
single-pass /loop fix. I made a genuine multi-angle attempt and pinned the wall precisely; the next concrete piece
is the texture decode+upload (re-engage cont.25 R0 / REX_TEXWATCH + GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN pieces 2-5). Diags
REX_MOVIEPROBE/REX_MOVIE_EOF_ALL retained.

## cont.36 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job") — BUILT + VERIFIED the Xenos tiled-texture DECODER (GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN piece 2 / cont.25 R0 keystone); measurement confirms attract-state binds NO populated textures (A↔B gate stands)

User re-issued /loop on the deep renderer build. cont.35's named "next concrete piece" was the texture decode+upload;
I built and **verified** the CPU side of it. New file `runtime/rex_texture.h` (header-only, included by kernel.cpp).
Default boot UNREGRESSED (96 assets, exit137, 0 crash markers, clamp 4×; all additions getenv-gated).

**WHAT (rex_texture.h):** the missing decode step's CPU side — guest Xenos texture bytes → linear RGBA8 the
renderer can upload:
- `XGAddress2DTiledOffset(x,y,width,texelPitch)` — the **documented Microsoft Xbox-360 2D-tiling address fn**
  (the one Xenia/noesis/xbox360 tools use), transcribed faithfully. + `Untile`/`Tile`/`TiledSizeBytes`.
- Format converters: `8_8_8_8` (A8R8G8B8), `5_6_5`, `1_5_5_5`, `4_4_4_4`, `8`, `8_8`, and **BC1/BC2/BC3**
  (DXT1/DXT2_3/DXT4_5) block decoders. + `EndianSwap` (8in16/8in32/16in32 per the fetch-const endian field).
- `Desc` (base/format/W/H/tiled/endian/pitch) + `DecodeBytesToRGBA` / `DecodeGuestToRGBA` top-level.

**VERIFIED (REX_TEXSELFTEST, runs in SetupEnvironment, gated; 9/9 PASS):**
- 6× **tiler round-trip** (32×32/64×32/128×128/16×16/64×64/48×80, bpb 2/4/8/16): linear→Tile→Untile == identity
  ⇒ Untile correctly inverts the address fn for these configs.
- **address-fn injectivity** over 64×64 (no two texels alias — a wrong formula usually collides).
- **BC1 known-vector**: hand-built little-endian DXT1 block (red c0 / blue c1, 4-color mode, rows idx 0/1/2/3) →
  decoded texels match the expected red / blue / ⅔R+⅓B interpolation ⇒ real correctness test of the BC1 path.
- **rat.dds 8888 decode** (32×16 A8R8G8B8 linear, the real game texture) → `/tmp/rat_decoded.ppm` = a **clearly
  recognizable grey rat with a pink tail/nose on black** (viewed, sent) ⇒ visual confirm of the 8888 converter +
  RGBA channel order (rat is grey/pink, not blue-tinted ⇒ R/B not swapped).
- Also fixed a plainly-wrong field in the [texbind] log: `tiled` was `(d0>>2)&1` (= sign_x bit 2); the documented
  bit is **dword0 bit31** (now `(d0>>31)&1`); added the `endian`=d1[7:6] field. Matches the movie-frame parse.

**⚠ HONEST verification GAP (rigor):** the round-trip proves *inversion*, NOT hardware-LAYOUT match — a
wrong-but-injective address fn round-trips too. Hardware-layout correctness of the TILED path rests on (a) the
faithful transcription of the documented MS algorithm and (b) the eventual real-tiled-texture PPM. I could NOT get
(b) from the live title this session — see the measurement below. The uncompressed + BC1 + 8888 paths ARE
correctness-tested (known-vector + real rat.dds art).

**⭐ MEASUREMENT (REX_TEXDECODE + REX_TEXBIND, 3 runs incl. 2 with the decode hook live):** at the default-boot
attract state (96-97 assets), the title binds **NO populated textures** — only the **1×1 empty EDRAM depth target**
(0xB0000000, fmt=0x16=k_24_8, nz=0/64). No `texdecode` PPM was produced (the hook fires only on a populated bind).
⇒ **decisively confirms cont.35 + resolves the long-standing R0/R1 tension toward R0**: the texture decode/upload
genuinely does NOT run at the attract state; cont.25 R1's "14/35 populated" was a **transient race-lucky capture
that does not reproduce** in normal runs. The textured draws (and their decoded textures) live behind the A↔B
title-advance — the deep build, exactly as cont.32-35 framed it.

**⇒ STATE:** the decoder (piece 2, CPU side) is DONE + verified on every path testable without live tiled data.
It's reusable renderer code, ready to plug into `rex_render::UploadTexture` the moment a real texture is available.
**NEXT concrete pieces (in tractability order):** (a) **tiled-path hardware confirmation via a raw-tiled DISK
asset** — parse a texture container (`Textures/Global.bin` / `hudimages.bin` / a `.xmc`) for a raw Xenos-tiled
texture, decode it, eyeball it; this ALSO opens a disk-resource textured-render path (real tiled game art, beyond
cont.24's source PNGs) and closes the verification gap WITHOUT needing the A↔B advance; (b) **GPU-side wire-up** —
`DecodeGuestToRGBA` → `rex_render::UploadTexture` → bind in the executed-draw path (currently only fires on the
rare populated bind); (c) the deep A↔B work (execute the real textured ring/segment draws so textures populate).
New gated diags: REX_TEXSELFTEST, REX_TEXDECODE. Default boot unregressed.

**⭐ DISK-CONTAINER finding (characterized, not yet coded — de-risks the next iteration).** The texture
containers the title loads (`Assets/Global/Textures/{HudImages,Global,Character,Enemy,Particle,…}.bin`, 11 of
them) are **zlib-compressed** (magic `78 da`). HudImages.bin = 13.8 MB → **80.4 MB** decompressed = a flat
sequence of **496 DDS textures**, each `[~12-byte mini-header {id, size, hash}] + [standard 128-byte DDS] +
[pixel data]`. ALL are **uncompressed 32-bit A8R8G8B8, LINEAR** (DDS `fourcc=0`, `bitcount=32`, pf_flags=0x41;
masks R=00FF0000 G=0000FF00 B=000000FF A=FF000000 — exactly my FMT_8_8_8_8). Extracted the 256×256 entry and
decoded it **through the real decoder** (REX_RATDDS path) → `/tmp/hud_256_decoded.png` = a recognizable red HUD
element (viewed). ⇒ **two conclusions:** (1) the disk-resource textured path is very tractable — 496 real
menu/HUD textures in a trivially-walkable container, my already-verified 8888 converter handles them; (2) the
disk data is **LINEAR**, so the title TILES at GPU-upload time (the missing step) and the disk **cannot** close
the tiler's hardware-confirmation gap — that still needs live tiled guest data (A↔B). The same DDS/8888 format is
what the title uploads, so the decoder + this container parse are the building blocks for BOTH the disk-resource
render and the live path. Artifacts: /tmp/HudImages.dec (decompressed), /tmp/hud_256.dds.

## cont.37 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job" — user: "continue, but first SHOW the render of real HUD textures") — the decoder goes LIVE: the title's REAL HUD textures rendered on the Vulkan swapchain

User asked to SEE real HUD textures rendered before continuing. Wired the cont.36 decoder into the render path and
rendered the title's own texture data — the first on-screen render of the **title's REAL textures** (vs cont.24's
external LevelSelectBG.png stand-in). Commit + image sent. Default boot UNREGRESSED (96 assets, exit137, 0 crash,
clamp 4×; all new code gated behind REX_HUDSHEET/REX_RENDER).

**WHAT (REX_HUDSHEET, vulkan_render.cpp):** the disk-resource render of the title's HUD textures, end-to-end:
- `InflateAll` (zlib streaming) inflates `Textures/HudImages.bin` (13.8 MB -> 80.4 MB) in-process.
- walk the DDS entries -> decode each via the cont.36 `rex_tex::DecodeBytesToRGBA` (8888 linear) -> composite the
  first 48 into a **1280x720 contact sheet** (8x6 grid, aspect-fit, alpha-composited over a subtle checker so the
  HUD art's transparency shows) -> `rex_render::UploadTexture` -> drawn as a full-screen quad through the existing
  textured pipeline (cont.23 `g_texPipe` + SPTextured FS). `rex_texture.h` now included in the renderer TU too;
  CMake links `ZLIB::ZLIB`.
- Wiring: reuses the REX_TEXTEST upload+draw branch (now `g_textest || g_hudsheet`), full-screen quad for hudsheet,
  menu validation rects skipped for a clean shot. CreateTexturedPipeline also fires for g_hudsheet.

**RESULT** (`DISPLAY=:0 REX_RENDER=1 REX_MENUTEST=1 REX_HUDSHEET=<HudImages.bin> REX_RENDER_SHOT=30` + run-base,
`timeout -s KILL -k 5 35`, AMD RADV POLARIS11): `[hudsheet] 13784311 -> 80458708`, `decoded + composited 48 HUD
textures (scanned 52 DDS) into a 1280x720 sheet`, `texture 1280x720 uploaded`. `/tmp/varianta_menu.ppm` ->
`/tmp/hudsheet_render.png` = **48 recognizable South Park HUD textures** (character portraits Cartman/Stan/Kyle/
Kenny, arrows, shields, medals, the sun icon, gems, the "RB" button prompt, health bars, coins) rendered cleanly,
**0 Vulkan errors**, image sent to the user. => the cont.36 decoder is LIVE in the render path on the title's real
texture data; the decode->upload->render pipeline works end-to-end.

**⚠ HONEST scope:** this textures the DISK container (linear A8R8G8B8 DDS, the 8888 path — NOT the tiler, which
needs live tiled data, cont.36). It's a contact-sheet demo of the title's real textures, NOT the title's live menu
layout (still A<->B-gated). But it (1) proves the decoder + the upload+render plumbing end-to-end on real game art,
(2) is reusable for the live path (same UploadTexture/textured pipeline), and (3) gives a real visible result. Run
hygiene respected: REX_RENDER in the FOREGROUND with `timeout -s KILL -k 5` (never bg+idle — the cont.30 6h-hang
lesson). New gated flag REX_HUDSHEET. NEXT: (a) map the contact-sheet approach toward the title's actual menu
composition, or render OTHER containers (Character/Enemy/Particle textures); (b) the live wire-up (decode the
title's tiled guest textures when a draw binds one); (c) the deep A<->B work.

## cont.38 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job") — REX_TEXSCAN: a COMPLETE bind-independent guest-memory sweep CORRECTS cont.25 R0 + decodes the title's OWN in-memory texture (the Microsoft splash) from guest memory

Planned step: rigorously settle whether the title has any decodable texture data in guest memory at the attract
state (rather than assume cont.25 R0's "texture blocks zero"). Built REX_TEXSCAN — a complete sweep of EVERY
texture-sized (>=256KB) physical allocation + the reg-file fetch region, with a decode-attempt. Default boot
UNREGRESSED (96 assets, exit137, 0 crash, clamp 4×; all gated behind REX_TEXSCAN). Image sent.

**⭐ CORRECTS cont.25 R0:** R0 sampled only the FIRST 924KB block (0xA49xxxxx) and called all GPU texture memory
zero. The complete sweep of all 24 texture-sized allocs shows a SPLIT:
- **0xA4–0xA5 GPU-texture-window blocks (the 5×924KB + 11×272KB, incl. cont.25's flagged 0xA4949000): ZERO** —
  confirms the upload-into-the-GPU-window doesn't run (the verdict HOLDS for the GPU window).
- **0xA27–0xA2F blocks (#3-7): POPULATED** with ARGB8888-looking pixels (first dwords FF8CA88C / FFFEFEFE /
  FF000000, alpha=FF) — the title's **decompressed image working buffers**, which cont.25 never looked at. block#7
  (0xA2FF9000, sz=0x384000 = exactly 1280×720×4) is a clean full-screen image.
- **fetch region: only EDRAM (0xB0000000) set, NO texture fetch const** — so no texture is bound; the fetch-path
  decode found nothing (0 decoded). Consistent with cont.36 (the attract state binds no real textures).

**⭐ DECODED the title's OWN in-memory texture:** decoding block#7 as linear 8888 (1280×720) →
`/tmp/texblk_A2FF9000_1280x720.ppm` = **the "Microsoft Game Studios" splash screen**, a clean recognizable image
straight from the title's guest memory (NOT a disk read), decoded 1:1 by the cont.36 decoder. (Blocks #3/#5/#6 are
also real images but my byte-count width-guess was wrong → sheared; their true dims live in the title's image
object, not a header — block#7 read first=FF8CA88C = raw pixels, no DDS magic.) Image sent to the user.

**⇒ FINDINGS:** (1) the decoder works on the title's REAL runtime texture data, not just disk files. (2) The title
decompresses images into LINEAR 8888 working buffers (0xA27–0xA2F); the tile+upload into the GPU window (0xA4–0xA5)
is the step that doesn't run (cont.25/35 verdict holds, now precisely located). (3) ⚠ these working buffers are
LINEAR (not tiled) and no fetch const references them ⇒ the tiler's HARDWARE confirmation STILL needs the A↔B
advance (no tiled guest data exists at attract) — but the scan found WHERE the title's texture data lives + a new,
more-authentic render source (the title's own decompressed images, incl. runtime-composed ones a disk read can't
give). New gated diag REX_TEXSCAN (tracks >=256KB allocs; sweeps blocks + fetch region; decodes populated blocks).
**NEXT:** (a) find the title's image object that tracks width/height (to decode blocks #3/#5/#6 correctly, not
sheared) — likely a struct near each buffer or in a registry; (b) hunt for the menu-BACKGROUND buffer (1280×720)
at the attract state → render the title's REAL menu bg from its own memory (more authentic than the disk
LevelSelectBG stand-in); (c) the deep A↔B work (the only path to live TILED textures + the real menu).

## cont.39 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job") — PINNED the texture-create call chain (the cont.25 R0 keystone): MmAllocate ← sub_824495D8 (generic allocator) ← sub_821B0F18 (render-range texture-create) ← sub_82108xxx

Goal: find the inlined-D3D texture-CREATE that allocates the GPU-window texture blocks (0xA4-0xA5) but never
populates them (cont.38: source images sit in linear working buffers 0xA27-0xA2F; the tile+upload doesn't run).
RE-only iteration (REX_TEXSCAN extended); default boot UNREGRESSED (96 assets, exit137, 0 crash, clamp 4×).

**Trace (reliable, via source + a hook — NOT fragile stack-walking):**
- The sole immediate caller of MmAllocatePhysicalMemoryEx is **sub_824495D8** (site 0x82449634) — a GENERIC
  physical-memory allocator used for ALL allocs (textures, working buffers, audio). So the texture-create is
  one level up. ⚠ PPC back-chain stack-walking from the import is UNRELIABLE in recompiled code — most "frames"
  decoded to data (e.g. FFFE0301 = the shader version token, not a return address); only the immediate ctx.lr is
  trustworthy.
- Hooked sub_824495D8 (override + call __imp__) and logged its caller when it returns a GPU-window (0xA4-0xA5)
  block → **two creators: sub_821B0F18 (site 0x821B0FF0, RENDER range 0x821Bxxxx) + sub_82448090 (loader range).**
  sub_821B0F18 is the render-side texture-create (the inlined-D3D create).
- Hooked sub_821B0F18, logged its args: it takes **0x9825xxxx resource-DESCRIPTOR objects** (r3=0x9825DF20/
  0x9825DDF8, r4=0x9825F050/0x9825F450, r5=0x9825D9../0x9825DE40), called from **sub_82108xxx** (0x82108F8C/
  0x821084E8); returns r3=0 (the allocated block is stored INTO the descriptor, not returned). The 0x9825xxxx
  objects are the same resource-working-memory class as cont.26 (0x9825F640 shader / 0x9825F860 stream).

**⇒ STATE:** the texture-create chain is pinned end to end. The source pixels / dims / format / dest-block live
inside the 0x9825xxxx descriptor structs that sub_821B0F18 consumes. The missing **populate (tile+copy source →
the allocated GPU block)** is the next layer — either a stubbed step in/after sub_821B0F18, or deferred to a GPU
copy the title's CP never runs (the A↔B coupling). This is genuine multi-step deep RE (confirms the keystone is a
sustained build, cont.10-35), now with the exact entry function (sub_821B0F18) localized. New gated diags:
[texalloc] (alloc + caller), [texcreate] (allocator→creator), [texcreatefn] (sub_821B0F18 signature) under
REX_TEXSCAN. **NEXT:** decode the sub_821B0F18 descriptor structs (which field = source ptr / width / height /
format / dest GPU block) → then either implement the tile+upload here (the keystone) or confirm it's GPU-deferred
(A↔B). Entry: sub_821B0F18 (ppc_recomp ~135148) + its 0x9825xxxx descriptors + the sub_82108xxx caller.

## cont.40 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job") — DECODED the texture-create: sub_821BE840 = CreateTexture (dims+format captured); the POPULATE (Lock/copy) is the precise missing step

Climbed the create/allocator chain to the actual texture-CREATE and read its signature. Default boot UNREGRESSED
(96 assets, exit137, 0 crash, clamp 4×; all gated behind REX_TEXSCAN). RE iteration (no new render).

**The chain, fully decoded (each level via a reliable hook + the resource path string):**
- **sub_821B0F18 = AUDIO resource-create** — its r4 = the resource PATH ("media\Assets\Audio\MainSoundBank.xsb").
  A RED HERRING (cont.39 mis-guessed it as the texture-create because it's render-range; it allocates GPU blocks
  for SOUND BANKS). Added a GuestStr() path decoder.
- **sub_82448090 (loader range) = the texture GPU-memory ALLOCATOR** — r3 = size (0xE1000=924KB / 0x43800=276KB =
  the cont.38 texture blocks); caller 0x821BE8F0. It just allocates the block (→ sub_824495D8 → MmAllocate).
- **⭐ sub_821BE840 = the TEXTURE-CREATE (D3D CreateTexture)** — args: **r3 = WIDTH** (0x500=1280 / 0x280=640),
  **r4 = HEIGHT** (0x2D0=720 / 0x168=360), r5=1 (depth), r6=1 (mips), **r8 = FORMAT token (0x28000002)**, r10=3;
  **returns a texture OBJECT (ret=0x06xxxxxx, the UI/texture range)** and allocates the GPU dest block (0xA49xxxxx).
  Caller 0x8232D488. The first texture is **1280×720** (full-screen — the menu bg / a render target; 1280×720×1 =
  0xE1000 = the 924KB block exactly → ~1 byte/px, consistent with DXT5/an 8-bit format).

**⭐ KEYSTONE PRECISELY LOCATED:** CreateTexture (sub_821BE840) **RUNS** — it allocates the GPU block + records
dims/format + returns a texture object — but it takes **NO source data** (it's an empty-texture alloc). So the
missing step (cont.25 R0 "allocates but the data-populate doesn't execute") is the **POPULATE = the title's
Lock/copy/Unlock that uploads the decompressed source (working buffers 0xA27-0xA2F, cont.38) into the texture
object's GPU block.** That Lock/copy/Unlock is what doesn't run (or is GPU-deferred = A↔B). New gated diags
[texdesc]/[texload]/[texcreate2] under REX_TEXSCAN; GuestStr() path decoder. **NEXT:** find the title's texture
POPULATE — how it writes data into the texture object (0x06xxxxxx) / its GPU block (Lock-Unlock, or a copy command)
— and why it doesn't run; then implement it (I have dims/format/dest from CreateTexture; need to bind the source
working buffer) OR confirm it's GPU-deferred. Entry: sub_821BE840 (the texture object 0x06xxxxxx + its GPU block) +
the caller 0x8232D488.

## cont.41 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job") — EXPERIMENT: filling the texture data does NOT advance the title ⇒ texture data-presence is NOT the gate; the L1 gate is the GPU-completion wait (cont.34), UPSTREAM of texture-uploads

Instead of climbing further, tested cont.35's hypothesis directly (cont.35: the advance is "gated on the level's
GPU resources being created (textures decoded+uploaded)"). REX_TEXFILL: in the sub_821BE840 (CreateTexture) hook,
after the create, eagerly fill the just-allocated GPU texture block with non-zero data (make it "present"), then
measure whether the title advances. Default boot UNREGRESSED (96 assets, exit137, 0 crash, clamp 4×; REX_TEXFILL
gated, the thread-local alloc-tracking is behavior-neutral).

**RESULT — filling textures does NOT advance the title:**
- ATTRACT (default boot + REX_TEXFILL): 97 assets ≈ baseline 96 (within run noise). 8 textures filled (the
  frontend textures, 1280×720 + 640×360, fmt=0x28000002). No advance.
- L1 (REX_SKIPINTRO + REX_HANDLERGUARD + REX_TEXFILL): **162 assets = the L1 baseline exactly, ZERO new asset
  opens.** Same 8 frontend texture fills (the L1-specific textures are NOT created — the title stalls BEFORE
  reaching them). No advance.

**⇒ DECISIVE: texture data-presence is NOT the advance gate.** Refines cont.35: the L1-start gate is **cont.34's
GPU-completion wait (the A↔B coupling)** — and it is **UPSTREAM of the texture-uploads** (only the 8 frontend
textures get created at L1; the title stalls in the render-completion spin BEFORE it creates/uploads the level's
textures). So the texture-create/upload keystone (cont.25 R0 / cont.39-40, sub_821BE840) is a **real but DOWNSTREAM
piece** — the title never reaches it because it's stuck waiting for GPU completion. ⚠ Caveat (rigor): the fill is
garbage data; if the gate were a per-texture readiness FLAG (not the pixels), filling pixels wouldn't set it — but
the L1 result (the level textures aren't even created) independently shows the stall is upstream of texture work.

**⇒ REDIRECT the deep build to cont.34's GPU-completion wait** (the root A↔B gate, characterized since cont.10):
the title's per-frame render-completion spin at L1 (REX_SPINTRACE: KeGetCurrentProcessType caller lr=0x821C6F78 in
sub_821C6F50 + 0x821BFF64/0x821C0864, all render-range) waits for a GPU completion variant A's present-only CP
never produces; the existing fence-forwards (sub_821C6E58/sub_821C5DF0) don't cover it. New gated diag REX_TEXFILL.
**NEXT:** attack the GPU-completion directly — pin the exact completion object/fence the L1 spin polls (sub_821C6F50
+ the 0x821BFF64/0x821C0864 sites) and produce it (execute the device+13568 L1 render segments → a real fence, or
forward the specific fence the spin waits on). This is the cont.34 "focused renderer session" core.

## cont.42 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job") — narrowed the L1 advance-gate: the completion DRAIN RUNS at L1 (not a stuck spin) ⇒ the gate is the uncreated L1-start gameplay subsystem, NOT the completion drain or texture-data

Measurement iteration (reused existing diags, no code change). Tested whether cont.34's "GPU-completion spin" is
the L1 gate by inspecting the completion machinery + the transition worker + the null subsystem at the L1 stall
(REX_SKIPINTRO + REX_HANDLERGUARD).

**Measured at L1 (162 assets, stalled):**
- **The completion DRAIN RUNS** (REX_LOADERPROBE [bf298]): count=4 items/frame, item0=[0,0,0x280,0x168]=640×360,
  IDENTICAL from #28000 to #40000 — exactly like attract (cont.25). ⇒ the title is **NOT stuck on the completion
  drain**; it renders the frontend backdrop per-frame fine. This REFINES cont.34: the "GPU-completion spin" is not
  a stuck drain — the drain works; the title just doesn't ADVANCE.
- **The loader is IDLE** ([ldframe]): child[0] state 0, only 1/20 children active, GPU textures/atlas/EDRAM all
  zero. Loading is done; nothing is in flight.
- **The transition worker fired EXACTLY ONCE** (REX_INITDIAG): sub_82250420 (tid10) → sub_8211B740 → sub_8210AF90
  ran once each (= the menu→L1-loading transition that loaded L1). It does NOT fire again for an L1-start.
- **The gameplay subsystem is NEVER created** (REX_GATEDIAG): sub_82292CE0 (frontend update, caller 0x8215079C)
  is called and reads *(0x827FD56C)=0x00000000 (null), vtable=0 — every time (3 calls). A genuine NULL, NOT a
  sentinel/not-ready guard (unlike the cont.30-31 gates). The subsystem ptr 0x827FD56C has **no literal reference
  in the recompiled code** (grep finds none — it's accessed via computed lis+addi addressing), confirming cont.35
  "the creator isn't a locatable direct store; it's inside the gated level-start path."

**⇒ NARROWED (ruling out hypotheses): the L1 advance-gate is the L1-START gameplay-subsystem CREATION — NOT the
completion drain (runs fine, cont.42), NOT texture-data (cont.41), NOT the menu-transition worker (fired once).**
The frontend (sub_82292CE0) expects the gameplay subsystem to exist by now; it's null because the level-start
(which creates it + switches frontend→gameplay) never fires after the 162-asset load completes. ⚠ HONEST: the
advance is a CHAIN of gates (cont.30-35) and the RENDER is SEPARATELY walled (cont.32: render at L1 = same
backdrop) — neither yields a quick visible win; this is the deep multi-week A↔B build (the spike estimate), not a
single-iteration crack. **NEXT:** pin the L1-START trigger — what should fire the level-start (gameplay-subsystem
creation) after loading completes (the "level loaded → start level" event/state-machine); find the
subsystem-creation site (it allocates then stores to 0x827FD56C via a computed pointer) + its gating condition.

## cont.43 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job") — the subsystem CREATOR is hidden behind indirection (static search for the direct-store pattern EXHAUSTED) ⇒ the level-start path is genuinely un-triggered; pivot to a runtime angle

Tried to find the gameplay-subsystem CREATOR (writes *(0x827FD56C), the L1-start gate) by static search. Decoded
the manager-access pattern from the consumer sub_82292CE0 (ppc_recomp.36): `lis r11,-32128; addi r31,r11,-10904`
⇒ **manager struct base = 0x827FD568**, subsystem ptr = `*(base+4)` = 0x827FD56C. So the creator should compute
that base and `PPC_STORE_U32(base+4, obj)`.

**Static search result — NO direct-store creator exists:** a precise scan (manager base in a register via
lis-32128/addi-10904 or addi-10900, still valid at a store to +4/+0) found **nothing**; a looser scan found 3
candidates (sub_82129380/sub_82151BA8/sub_821571D8) but ALL are **false positives** — they store to a DIFFERENT
struct's +4 (the base register was reassigned, e.g. sub_82151BA8 stores to (r31+60)+4; sub_82129380's base is a
loaded ptr *(r30-4420); sub_821571D8's r31 is a big unrelated struct). ⇒ **the creator does NOT use the
compute-the-constant-then-store pattern** — it writes 0x827FD56C INDIRECTLY (most likely it receives a pointer to
the slot, e.g. `Create(&manager->sub)` storing via the passed reg, or loads the manager base from a non-constant
pointer). Combined with REX_GATEDIAG (always reads 0), the subsystem is **genuinely never created in variant A**;
the level-start path that constructs it is un-triggered (confirms cont.35 "no locatable direct store").

**⇒ static RE is exhausted for the creator; pivot to RUNTIME.** ⚠ Honest meta: the advance-gate (cont.34/41/42/43)
is a deep state-machine/A↔B problem — the completion drain runs (cont.42), texture-data isn't it (cont.41), and
the subsystem creator is indirection-hidden (cont.43). This is the multi-week build; the autonomous /loop is
producing rigorous narrowing (documented findings) but not a single-iteration crack. **NEXT (runtime angles):**
(a) instrument the tid10 transition worker (sub_82250420) at L1 — is it still looping/polling for a NEXT transition
(loading→running) whose condition is unmet (the gate), or has it exited?; (b) find the "level loaded → start level"
detector (what polls the loader-done state and should fire the level-start); (c) trace the frontend state machine
(sub_8215079C) for the gameplay-start decision point. Or redirect to visible decoder-driven render work (the
tractable half of the renderer) — user's call.

## cont.44 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job — render the real menu from working buffers") — ⭐ user redirected to the render path; MAJOR CORRECTION: the GPU texture window POPULATES over time at attract; decoded the title's REAL menu/attract textures

User explicitly redirected: "рендери реальное меню из working-буферов." Pivoted to the render path. Two images
sent. Default boot UNREGRESSED (96 assets, exit137, 0 crash, clamp 4×; all gated behind REX_TEXSCAN).

**(1) Working buffers (0xA2x) at attract = the title's INTRO LOGOS, not a menu.** Improved REX_TEXSCAN (DDS-container
scan + multi-candidate-width decode). The populated 0xA27-0xA2F blocks decode (correct dims by size-match) to the
title's real **frontend logo sequence**: 0xA2FF9000 = Microsoft Game Studios splash (1280×720), 0xA2F25000 =
Comedy Central logo (384×448) — both clean, 1:1, decoded by my decoder from the title's runtime memory (image sent).
A few other blocks are pitch-padded/odd-factor (sheared, unresolved). ⇒ the working buffers hold the boot/intro
logos; the interactive MENU is composed at runtime (attract-movie + HUD sprites) and is behind the advance-gate,
so it's NOT a static working-buffer image at this state.

**(2) ⭐⭐ MAJOR CORRECTION — the GPU texture window POPULATES OVER TIME at attract.** Sampling REX_TEXSCAN at
multiple vbc (60→1860) shows the populated tex-alloc count GROWS: 8→158 allocations, **5→103 POPULATED** over ~30s,
INCLUDING GPU-window blocks (0xA51xxxxx-0xA5Exxxxx). **cont.38/42 sampled TOO EARLY (vbc 60-660) and wrongly
concluded "GPU window zero" — the title DOES tile+upload its textures at attract, just later.** This also softens
the cont.41 framing (the populate DOES run at attract; the L1 stall is a separate, earlier gate).

**(3) ⭐ Decoded the title's REAL textures (CreateTexture-correlated).** Recorded each GPU block's dims from the
CreateTexture hook (sub_821BE840, cont.40) → for each populated GPU-window block, decoded at the CORRECT dims +
format inferred from bytes/px → **the title's real menu/attract/gameplay textures**: a radial **sunburst**
background, **tornado / lightning / fire** effect sprites, **character sprite-sheets** (bright-green = chroma/alpha
key), rings, orbs, red UI panels (256×256 & 512×512 8888; a 1920×1080 DXT1 backdrop). Image sent. ⇒ FIRST decode
of the title's real GAMEPLAY/menu texture set from its GPU memory.

**(4) ⚠ TILER status — the GPU-window textures are stored LINEAR, not tiled.** Decoding them as TILED (my cont.36
XGAddress2DTiledOffset) gives a **honeycomb scramble**; decoding LINEAR gives the coherent real textures (above).
So these are linear surfaces, and **the cont.36 tiler remains UNCONFIRMED against real tiled data** — cont.36's
honest caveat (round-trip proves inversion, NOT hardware-layout) stands; the honeycomb is the first real-data
signal and would be the test bed IF a genuinely tiled texture is found. New gated diags under REX_TEXSCAN:
[texscan] DDS-container scan, multi-width candidates, CreateTexture-correlated decode (texct_*, tiled+linear),
late multi-vbc sampling. **NEXT:** (a) compose the real textures into the actual menu LAYOUT (needs the per-draw
mapping / the draw stream — cont.24's open problem); (b) find a genuinely TILED texture to fix/confirm the tiler;
(c) the advance-gate (deep A↔B) for the live interactive menu.

## cont.45 (2026-06-06, /loop "render the real menu from working buffers") — the faithful composed MENU is blocked (executed draws have stubbed texture bindings even at late attract); the GPU-window textures are gameplay sprite-sheets + logos, not a composable menu screen

Continued the render-path redirect: tried to render the title's actual composed menu (bind the now-populated
GPU-window textures to the title's draws). Measurement iteration (no code change). Two findings:

**(1) The faithful menu composition is BLOCKED — the executed draws have stubbed texture bindings, even at late
attract.** REX_EXECSEGS + REX_SCENE at a late attract state (50s, after the GPU window populates): the executed
device+13568 segment draws are STILL the frontend placeholders — prim5 sprite at off-screen (-253,-226) tex=0x0,
prim4 tri at (64,36) tex=0x0, prim13 text tex=0x0, prim8 backdrop = EDRAM(0xB0000000) empty. **NO draw binds a real
GPU-window texture.** So the real per-draw texture→draw mapping is NOT in the executed segments — it's in the
inlined-D3D SetTexture path that the recomp stubbed (cont.23-24 dead-end), confirmed now at late attract: the
populated textures (cont.44) are bound by the kicked ring IBs variant A doesn't execute, not the segments.

**(2) The GPU-window textures are gameplay EFFECT sprite-sheets, not menu UI.** The clean-decoded 512×512 (e.g.
0xA55C2000) is a 16-frame green-screen EXPLOSION/poof animation (green = chroma/alpha key); others are tornado/
lightning/fire FX + a sunburst + red UI panels (cont.44). The 1920×1080 DXT1 (0xA51C3000) does NOT decode clean
(grid artifact — tiled, or wrong format/dims). So there's no single full-screen "menu" image in the GPU window;
the complete faithful frontend renders remain the intro LOGOS (working buffers: Microsoft splash + Comedy Central,
cont.44).

**⇒ HONEST CONCLUSION for "render the real menu":** the real TEXTURES are decoded + shown (cont.44), but the
COMPOSED menu SCREEN cannot be faithfully rendered — the title's menu draw→texture bindings are stubbed (the
recompiled inlined-D3D path), so the exact layout requires the deep render build (reconstruct the SetTexture/
SetStreamSource bindings, cont.23 entry sub_821F8E60). A heuristic compose (real textures at guessed positions)
is possible but would be a MOCK-UP, not the title's real layout. NEXT: either the deep render build (reconstruct
the stubbed per-draw bindings — the path to the real composed menu) or a clearly-labeled heuristic compose if a
visible menu-like result is wanted over fidelity.

## cont.46 (2026-06-06, /loop "render the real menu from working buffers") — delivered a clearly-labeled heuristic MENU MOCK-UP composed from the title's real decoded textures

The user has asked 3x for a visible menu; the faithful layout is blocked (cont.45, stubbed bindings = deep render
build). So fulfilled the directive as best possible: composed a 1280x720 menu mock-up entirely from the title's
REAL decoded textures (image tools, no code change) and sent it, clearly labeled "real textures, heuristic layout
— NOT the title's real layout." Elements: Comedy Central logo (working buffer 0xA2F25000, 384x448) as the title;
red UI panels (GPU texture 0xA54AE000) as menu buttons; sunburst glow (0xA5307000); a character (0xA5E75000); a
sky-gradient background (0xA551A000) — all decoded by the cont.36 decoder from the title's runtime memory.

Honest framing (sent to the user): this is a DEMO that the decoder works on the title's real art + what a menu from
those textures looks like; the LAYOUT is mine, not the title's. The real composed layout needs the deep render
build (reconstruct the stubbed SetTexture/SetStreamSource per-draw bindings, cont.23 entry sub_821F8E60 — multi-
session). Offered the user the choice: (a) start the deep render build for the real layout, (b) accept the mock-up,
(c) redirect. NEXT (absent redirect): begin the deep render build's first piece (reconstruct one per-draw binding)
as the path to the faithful menu, or the advance-gate.

## cont.47 (2026-06-06, /loop "render the real menu") — USER CHOSE THE DEEP RENDER BUILD (AskUserQuestion); started it: traced the per-draw binding keystone (sub_821F8E60 text renderer → vtable[15])

After delivering the achievable (decoder + real textures + menu mock-up, cont.44-46) and establishing the faithful
menu is doubly-blocked, I asked the user (AskUserQuestion) how to proceed. **They chose "Глубокий render-билд"
(the deep render build)** — explicit authorization for the multi-week effort toward the title's real interactive
menu. Pacing it across iterations.

**First step — picked up cont.23's left-off point (the stubbed per-draw bind+draw).** REX_UITRACE: the text
renderer sub_821F8E60 Locks/fills a dynamic VB (obj 0x000E36A0, vtable 0x820E0B10 → 0xA022FFF0) via vtable[30]
(sub_822052B0) and "Unlock/submits" via **vtable[31] = sub_822052F8** — which cont.24 found is TRIVIAL (device
bookkeeping, not a draw). So the bind+draw is NOT in the Unlock. Read sub_821F8E60 (ppc_recomp.21:22604+) AFTER
the Unlock: it checks the VB ptr (r30, the fill result) then calls the RENDERER object's **vtable[15]**
(`*(*(r31)+60)`, args r3=r31, r4=0) and returns — the filled VB (r30) is NOT explicitly SetStreamSource'd/drawn in
this function. ⇒ **the actual bind+draw is the renderer's vtable[15] (offset 60)** — the next link to trace. So
the chain is: sub_821F8E60 (fill VB) → renderer.vtable[15](this,0) → (the real SetStreamSource + DrawPrimitive,
which is where the binding is stubbed/lost).

**⇒ DEEP-BUILD plan (authorized), keystone = the per-draw binding:** the decoder + texture-decode are DONE
(cont.36/44); the keystone is reconstructing the stubbed per-draw VERTEX binding (this chain: sub_821F8E60 →
renderer.vtable[15]) + the TEXTURE binding (the inlined-D3D SetTexture, cont.24 dead-end) so the executed draws
fetch the real VB + texture. Then the advance-gate (A↔B) for the interactive menu state. **NEXT:** trace the
renderer's vtable[15] (offset 60) — find the SetStreamSource(VB)+DrawPrimitive it should emit, and reconstruct it
(bind slot-0 = the filled VB 0xA022FFF0 for the executed UI draws). Entry: sub_821F8E60 + renderer vtable[15].

## cont.48 (2026-06-06, /loop "render the real menu" — deep render build, paced) — mapped the texture side: LOADED textures populate, GENERATED textures (font atlas / EDRAM) never do at attract

Deep-build RE. Found cont.23 already renders the UI vertex GEOMETRY (count-correlation), so the keystone blocker
is the TEXTURE side. Checked whether the text draws' FONT ATLAS is available (REX_LOADERPROBE [ldframe], 10 samples
over the full attract run): **0xA5004800 (font atlas) = 0 and 0xB0000000 (EDRAM) = 0 the ENTIRE run** — never
populated. Contrast cont.44: the LOADED gameplay textures (explosions/FX/UI, from files) DO populate the GPU window
over time. ⇒ **the deep render build's texture side SPLITS:** (a) LOADED textures (file → decode → GPU) populate +
are decodable (cont.44) — the tractable half; (b) GENERATED textures — the font atlas (TTF rasterization of the
.ttf) and the EDRAM render-to-texture backgrounds — NEVER run (the raster/RT generation is stubbed/gated) — so
TEXT and the EDRAM backdrop are blocked at the GENERATION step, on top of the per-draw binding + advance-gate.

**⇒ deep-build map (4 blockers, all multi-week):** (1) per-draw VERTEX binding — mostly solved (count-correlation);
(2) per-draw TEXTURE binding for LOADED textures (inlined-D3D SetTexture stubbed, cont.24) — TRACTABLE next; (3)
GENERATED textures (font atlas TTF raster + EDRAM RT) — don't run; (4) advance-gate (A↔B) — the on-screen menu
state (attract draws are off-screen placeholders). A visible REAL menu needs ≥ (2)+(4) (and text needs (3)). NEXT:
push the tractable half — the per-draw TEXTURE binding for the loaded textures (find the title's SetTexture: hook
CreateTexture sub_821BE840 → record texObj→GPU-base, then find who reads the texObj to bind it / writes the draw's
texture fetch const). That's the path to texturing the title's real draws with the available loaded textures.

## cont.49 (2026-06-06, /loop "render the real menu" — deep build, paced) — traced the text bind+draw path (confirms cont.23) + CONSOLIDATED the deep-build roadmap into GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN.md

Deep-build RE: traced the text renderer's bind+draw. sub_821F8E60 (ppc_recomp.21:22258) takes a material/renderer
arg (r4, color@+164), fills a dynamic VB (→0xA022FFF0), and RETURNS it (r3) to its 2 callers (21874, 22228), which
store it (r1+104) and build glyph geometry in a loop (per-glyph float math + vtable calls) then draw. So the
vertex/geometry path is the cont.23 territory (already rendered via count-correlation); the text TEXTURE is the
font atlas, which cont.48 showed NEVER populates (generated-texture blocker #3). ⇒ the text path is blocked at the
atlas; the tractable texture path is the SPRITE draws (loaded textures, which DO populate, cont.44).

**Consolidated the deep-build state (cont.36-48) into an actionable roadmap at the top of GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN.md**
— the 4 blockers (1 vertex binding mostly-solved, 2 texture binding for loaded textures = tractable, 3 generated
textures don't run, 4 advance-gate), the critical path ((4)→(1)+(2)+(3)), the entry points, and what's DONE
(decoder + loaded-texture decode). This structures the multi-week build for execution. NEXT executable piece:
(2) the per-draw texture binding for loaded textures — find the inlined-D3D SetTexture recording (hook CreateTexture
sub_821BE840 for the texObj→GPU-base map, then find who reads the texObj / writes the segment's texture fetch-const).

## cont.50 (2026-06-06, /loop "render the real menu" — deep build, paced) — the advance-gate's registrations are SYSTEMATICALLY indirection-hidden (static RE exhausted); pivot to the PROD-ORACLE

Worked the critical-path blocker (piece 4, the advance-gate). Piece 2 (SetTexture) is gated behind the menu state
(textures aren't set for the attract PLACEHOLDER draws — cont.45), so the menu state must be reached first. The menu
state has the menu-setup handler gate (cont.31: *(0x828183A0) = 0xFFFFFFFF unregistered sentinel; forcing it → L1).
Tried to find the handler's REGISTRATION (the proper fix vs cont.31's guard): decoded the access (sub_824253C8,
ppc_recomp.59:21119 — base 0x82820000 via lis -32126, offset -31840 → 0x828183A0, + the +4 field); a precise search
for the WRITER (lis -32126 / addi -31840 + a store to +0/+4) found **NOTHING** — like the gameplay-subsystem creator
(cont.43). ⇒ **the advance-gate's gate-clearing registrations (menu-setup handler 0x828183A0 + gameplay subsystem
0x827FD56C) are SYSTEMATICALLY indirection-hidden** (written via passed pointers / computed bases, not direct
stores). **Static RE for the advance-gate is EXHAUSTED.**

**⇒ PIVOT to the PROD-ORACLE (cont.25's suggested method).** The prod recomp binary exists
(out/build/linux-amd64-release/south_park_td, 20MB, WORKING — reaches gameplay). prod + variant A are
recompilations of the SAME XEX (same sub_XXXX); the advance-gate gap is in variant A's RUNTIME (a stub returns
not-ready) vs prod's full runtime — the subsystem-creation/handler-registration path runs in prod but stalls in
variant A. Catching HOW prod does it → replicate in variant A. NEXT: prod-oracle — e.g. an LD_PRELOAD software
watchpoint (mprotect + SIGSEGV-catch, no gdb [cont.25: gdb impractical for the recomp's lazy-paging SIGSEGV]) on
0x827FD56C / 0x828183A0 in prod to catch the writer PC → map to the recompiled function → find the runtime trigger
variant A stubs. ⚠ HONEST: this needs prod's guest g_base (to compute the host watch address) + careful SIGSEGV
handling = a significant tooling effort (focused session). The deep-build advance-gate is genuinely autonomously-
hard; the achievable renders (decoder + real textures + mock-up) are delivered (cont.44-46).

## cont.51 (2026-06-06, /loop) — PROD-ORACLE ENABLED: prod runs autonomously; prod g_base=0x100000000; gdb IS usable

The pivot's prerequisites, all SOLVED (correcting cont.25's "gdb impractical" assumption):
- **prod runs autonomously.** Launch invocation (from `gamectl.sh`): cwd = `out/build/linux-amd64-release`,
  `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. DISPLAY=:0 setsid ./south_park_td --game_data_root=<root>/private/extracted
  --user_data_root=<root>/private/userdata --license_mask=1 --mnk_mode=true --always_win=true --window_width=960
  --window_height=540 --log_file=run.log`. prod reaches the title (run.log: `swaps 60.0/s loading=false`).
- ⚠⚠ **CRITICAL LESSON: kill prod with `pkill -x south_park_td` (exact name), NEVER `pkill -f south_park_td`.**
  `-f` matches the *full cmdline*, which includes my OWN bash command containing "south_park_td" → it kills my own
  shell → every prod launch attempt returned "exit 1, no output". I misdiagnosed this for ~5 attempts as "prod won't
  run / advance-gate autonomously-blocked." It was the self-kill. Use `-x`.
- **prod guest memory = Xenia-style /dev/shm**, mapped at host **g_base = 0x100000000** (so guest 0x82XXXXXX → host
  0x182XXXXXX). 970 mappings; main = 1.75GB rw-s /dev/shm/xenia_memory_*. Deterministic (MAP_FIXED) across runs.
- **gdb 17.1 IS available and prod is NOT stripped (32915 syms, same `sub_XXXXXXXX` guest-addr naming as variant A).**
  ⇒ a gdb **hardware** watchpoint (debug-register, near-native speed — not the slow software-watchpoint cont.25
  feared) on the host gate-global address gives a fully-SYMBOLIZED writer backtrace. prod↔variant A map 1:1 by sub_.

## cont.52 (2026-06-06, /loop) — ⭐BREAKTHROUGH: the menu-handler gate is XAM PARTY-FEATURE DETECTION; XexLoadImage/XexGetProcedureAddress stub bug FIXED (proper, replaces REX_HANDLERGUARD)

Ran the prod-oracle end-to-end and CRACKED + FIXED the menu-handler gate (0x828183A0). Method + findings:

**1. Premise validated (prod populates the gate globals).** Read prod's live guest memory at the title:
0x827FD568=0x820e6b0c, **0x827FD56C=0x45fe78b0** (heap obj; variant A=NULL), **0x828183A0=0x825f0c18** (variant A=
0xFFFFFFFF sentinel). prod sets what variant A leaves null/sentinel — the gate is real.

**2. prod watchpoint → exact writer call-chains** (gdb HW watchpoint armed at `rex::ReXApp::OnPreLaunchModule`, the
moment guest memory is mapped but the guest thread hasn't run):
  - 0x828183A0 ← 0x825f0c18 : `xstart → sub_82450350 → sub_825906D0 → sub_82425480` (store)
  - 0x827FD56C ← 0x45fe78b0 : `xstart → sub_82249638 → sub_82249678 → sub_8214FFD0 → sub_82292B10 → sub_8248F4C8`

**3. variant A reaches ALL of them** (gdb breakpoints on the 8 chain fns, variant A boot): every fn incl. both leaf
writers HIT. ⇒ the divergence is INSIDE the writers (value/branch), NOT reachability. (Corrects cont.43/50's "writer
never runs / indirection-hidden" — it runs; the static WRITER search failed because the store is `stw r3,0(r31)`
with r31 = the *passed-in* struct ptr 0x828183A0, not a `lis/addi`-built constant address.)

**4. variant A watchpoint → the exact bug.** variant A writes 0x828183A0 = **0xFFFFFFFF** at `sub_82425480`
(ppc_recomp.59.cpp:21281, the `stw r3,0(r31)` of `sub_8244E250(handle,2815)`'s result). Decoding sub_82425480:
it's **optional XAM Party/Community feature-detection** — `handle = sub_8244E290 = XexLoadImage("xam.xex")` (name
@guest 0x82068808), then `sub_8244E250 = XexGetProcedureAddress(handle, ord)` for ords **0xAFF XamPartyGetUserList,
0xB00 XamPartySendGameInvites, 0xB0B XamPartySetCustomData, 0xB10 XamPartyGetBandwidth, 0x305 XamShowPartyUI,
0x30B XamShowCommunitySessionsUI**, filling the table 0x828183A0..B4 (+0xB8 = handle). prod resolves these to real
IAT thunks 0x825f0c18..2c (handle 0x3000b000); the title's main XEX has NO export table (exportTable VA=0) — these
are RUNTIME-resolved xam imports.

**5. ROOT CAUSE.** variant A's generated weak stubs `__imp__XexLoadImage` / `__imp__XexGetProcedureAddress` return
`r3=0` (=STATUS_SUCCESS) WITHOUT writing the caller's out-param. The wrappers check `bge` (status≥0 ⇒ success) then
read the **un-written out buffer = uninitialised stack = 0xFFFFFFFF** → the Party table fills with garbage pointers
→ the title thinks Party is available with bogus fn-ptrs → hang (the cont.31 sentinel `REX_HANDLERGUARD` was a
band-aid over this).

**6. FIX (kernel.cpp:805-823, commit this cont.).** Strong overrides:
`PPC_FUNC(__imp__XexLoadImage){ ctx.r3.u64=0xFFFFFFFF; }` and same for `__imp__XexGetProcedureAddress` — return a
NEGATIVE status (module/ordinal NOT found). variant A hosts no loadable XEX modules (all imports compile-time), so
not-found is the FAITHFUL result (a console/dashboard lacking Party). The wrappers' `bge` now fails → their clean
failure path (`li r3,0`, no out-buffer read) → `sub_82425480` early-outs → table stays 0 → the title gracefully
disables Party. VERIFIED (gdb): override resolves to kernel.cpp:815 (not the weak stub) and IS hit; 0x828183A0 no
longer becomes 0xFFFFFFFF (stays 0); the title reaches the cont.34 L1 GPU-completion spin **WITHOUT** REX_HANDLERGUARD.
**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (0 crashes, full 30s, 407k lines). ⇒ proper fix; REX_HANDLERGUARD no longer needed.

**Tools added** (varianta/tools/): `prod_read.py` (read guest globals from running prod via /proc/pid/mem at
g_base 0x100000000), `oracle.gdb` (prod HW-watchpoint → symbolized writer bt), `diverge.gdb` (variant A breakpoints
on a call-chain → which fns are reached), `vawatch.gdb`/`vatest.gdb` (variant A base-relative HW watchpoint).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.53): apply the SAME oracle to the SUBSYSTEM gate 0x827FD56C** (the cont.33 post-L1 gate; prod chain
`sub_82292B10 → sub_8248F4C8` writes a HEAP object 0x45fe78b0). variant A reaches sub_8248F4C8 — watch 0x827FD56C in
variant A (longer timeout; the subsys write is at frontend init, later than the handler write) to see what value it
writes and why null (allocation-fail? another import stub? a branch). That gate (not the handler) is what cont.33
flagged as blocking post-L1 — and after it, the cont.34 GPU-completion spin is the renderer wall proper.

## cont.53 (2026-06-06, /loop) — ⭐SUBSYSTEM gate 0x827FD56C ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (XamUserReadProfileSettings returns the wrong error code); ⚠creating it exposes the timer-stub → GATED behind REX_SUBSYS

Applied the prod-oracle to the subsystem gate. Traced it with gdb breakpoints + ctx-field reads (variant A has DWARF).

**The factory sub_8248F4C8 (called once, r7=0x827FD56C out-slot) does 4 gated steps; only the INIT fails:**
sub_82497720→0 ok; sub_824898C0 (OBJECT-CREATE)→0x610e730 ok; sub_8244E5C0→0xcafe0001 ok; **sub_82493F98 (INIT)
→ E_FAIL (0x80004005)** → object torn down → stores 0 → null subsystem. So the object IS created; only its init fails.

**Drilled the init 6 levels** (sub_82493F98→sub_82493EB0→sub_824C74F0→sub_824C7450→sub_824C70A0→**sub_824C9500**).
sub_824C70A0 is a singleton component-init (alloc 1200B ok, singleton 0x82819D90 was 0 = first init ok); its 4-entry
registration loop calls sub_824C9500 which returns E_FAIL on entry 0. Inside sub_824C9500: it calls
**XamUserReadProfileSettings** and checks the IMMEDIATE return **`== 122`** (raw Win32 ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER);
`!=122` → `ori r22,16389` = 0x80004005 E_FAIL.

**ROOT CAUSE:** the existing kernel.cpp override returned `overlapped ? 0 : 0x8007007A` for a size query. At this
call (traced): bufPtr=0 (size query), **overlapped=0x82610000 (non-zero)** → returned **0** → `!=122` → E_FAIL →
the gameplay subsystem (0x827FD56C) was NEVER created (exactly the cont.33 "post-L1 NULL subsystem" gate). Real XAM
returns 122 (raw ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER, NOT the HRESULT 0x8007007A) for a size query.

**FIX (kernel.cpp:4057) + ✅VERIFIED:** return 122 (0x7A) for the size query → sub_82493F98 INIT now returns 0 →
**0x827FD56C = 0x610e730 (NON-NULL, subsystem created)**. (gdb-confirmed end-to-end via the factory trace.)

**⚠ BUT this REGRESSES default boot, so it's GATED behind REX_SUBSYS.** Creating the subsystem makes it spawn its
worker thread (tid10, start 0x824C6ED0) which then blocks on the still-stubbed NtCreateTimer/NtSetTimerEx →
default boot stalls at frontend-init (654 lines) BEFORE the attract loop. KEY insight: the E_FAIL was previously
handled GRACEFULLY (the title reached the attract spin WITHOUT the subsystem) ⇒ **the subsystem is a GAMEPLAY
subsystem (post-L1), NOT on the menu/attract path.** So the fix advances gameplay, not the menu. Gated:
`static bool subsysFix = getenv("REX_SUBSYS"); r3 = subsysFix ? 0x7A : (overlapped?0:0x8007007A);`. ✅ default boot
UNREGRESSED (no flag: 400k lines, attract spin, 0 crashes, full 30s); REX_SUBSYS=1: subsystem created, 0 crashes.

Tools: varianta/tools/{subsys.gdb (factory 4-step trace), subsys2.gdb (sub_824C70A0 branch trace), profread.gdb
(XamUserReadProfileSettings args/return)}.

**⇒ NEXT (cont.54):** the subsystem worker (tid10, start 0x824C6ED0) blocks on NtCreateTimer/NtSetTimerEx — implement
a real timer primitive (host timer thread signaling the guest event) so the worker runs, then make REX_SUBSYS
default-on. THEN reassess whether the created subsystem changes anything on the MENU path (likely not — it's
gameplay; the menu/attract is reached without it). ⚠ STRATEGY NOTE: cont.52 (menu handler) + cont.53 (subsystem)
both cracked real gates via the oracle, but NEITHER is the menu RENDER blocker — the menu/attract is reached, and the
wall is still cont.34's GPU-completion spin (the renderer proper). To actually SEE the menu, the renderer
(GPU-completion / per-draw bind, cont.34/23-24) remains the work; the gate-cracks are gameplay-path progress.

## cont.54 (2026-06-06, /loop) — REFOCUS to the menu RENDERER; fully traced the per-draw SetTexture chain to REAL code ⇒ the cont.24 "tex=0x0" dead-end REFRAMED: SetTexture is DEFERRED device-state, the gap is the draw-time FLUSH → command stream

Pivoted the menu-render attack (per cont.53's insight that the gates are gameplay-path). Re-grounded by reading
the renderer: the attract/menu loop RUNS (sub_821C6F50 = per-frame GPU-command building, NOT a spin); the wall is
that variant A's executed draws render with **tex=0x0** (cont.45). variant A's PM4 interpreter DOES handle both
SET_CONSTANT (0x2D) and SET_CONSTANT2 (0x55) into the fetch region (0x4800), so the binding isn't a missing PM4
opcode.

**Traced the cont.47-49 per-draw keystone end-to-end via gdb (variant A has DWARF; tools vtbl15.gdb, settex.gdb):**
text renderer `sub_821F8E60` → (vtable[15] = `*(*(r31)+60)`) `sub_821FFB10` (per-draw SetTexture *wrapper*: gets the
texture's GPU handle via the resource's vtable[2], redundancy-checks `r30+392`, else calls device.vtable[8]) →
(device.vtable[8] = `*(*(r30+332)+32)`) **`sub_82204BD0`** (called with REAL texture handles 0x610feb0/0x60fee40/…,
some 0x0 = textureless) → `sub_821BEC00` (the actual D3D SetTexture).

**⭐REFRAMING of the cont.23-24 dead-end:** `sub_821BEC00` does NOT write a fetch-constant or build a SET_CONSTANT —
it stores the texture binding into a **DEFERRED per-stage device-state structure** (descriptor fields +0/4/8/12/16/20,
state arrays indexed by sampler stage) and sets a **DIRTY flag** (`*(r31+13732)`), then calls sub_821CAA18. So the
ENTIRE per-draw SetTexture chain is REAL recompiled code that RUNS — the texture binding IS recorded in device state.
The fetch-constant is written later, at a **draw-time FLUSH** (dirty device-state → SET_CONSTANT in the command
buffer, just before DrawPrimitive). ⇒ cont.45's tex=0x0 is NOT "SetTexture stubbed/lost" (cont.24's framing) — it's
that the **deferred-state flush doesn't reach the command stream variant A executes** (the EXECSEGS deferred segments
device+13568 are a different/placeholder stream; the real per-frame draws+flush go elsewhere — the cont.34 "circular
A↔B" / which-command-buffer question).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.55):** find the draw-time FLUSH — where the dirty device texture-state (set by sub_821BEC00, flag
*(r31+13732)) is applied to fetch-constants in a command buffer before DrawPrimitive. Identify WHICH command buffer/
stream the flush + the real per-frame draws target, vs what variant A's renderer executes (EXECSEGS=device+13568 vs
the ring). Closing that gap (execute the real per-frame draw+flush stream) is the per-draw-texture-binding fix = the
visible menu. No code change this iteration (investigation/tracing); tools added: vtbl15.gdb, settex.gdb.

## cont.55 (2026-06-06, /loop) — captured the per-draw SetTexture STREAM (real texture handles per menu draw) via a runtime hook; texObj→GPU-block resolution still pending

Built the per-draw texture-binding capture (REX_TEXSEQ). Hooked **sub_821BEC00** (the D3D SetTexture leaf, cont.54).
⚠ LESSON: sub_821FFB10 / sub_82204BD0 are called INDIRECTLY (vtable → dispatch table → __imp__), which BYPASSES a
weak-alias override — a runtime hook only fires on a DIRECTLY-called function. sub_821BEC00 is a direct `bl` from
sub_82204BD0, so `PPC_FUNC(sub_821BEC00)` fires (gdb-confirmed: resolves to kernel.cpp, hit). Also added a
texObj→GPU-block map (g_texObjToBlock) populated from the CreateTexture hook (sub_821BE840 return).

**MEASURED (attract, headless):** the hook fires; the menu's per-draw SetTexture stream IS captured —
interspersed stage-clears (texH=0, stage walks the sampler-mask bits) then REAL texture handles
**0x0610FEB0 / 0x060FEE40 / …** (0x06xxxxxx, matching the cont.54 settex trace). So the title DOES bind real
per-draw textures (recorded in device state, cont.54). ⚠ But they DON'T resolve to a GPU block: g_texObjToBlock is
empty for them (CreateTexture sub_821BE840 didn't record these texObjs — either a different create path, or its
return isn't the same 0x06xxxxxx object), and the handle's first words (h[0..3]=00100003 00000001 00000000…) are NOT
the GPU base. So the handle→GPU-block→decoded-texture data path is NOT yet closed.

⚠ Also (cont.54 decoupling stands): even fully resolved, this LIVE stream can't bind per-draw at the (batched) draw
time — the real fix is still the deferred-state FLUSH reaching variant A's executed command buffer. The stream
capture is the GROUND TRUTH of which textures the menu binds (useful for verifying any future bind), not itself the fix.

Default boot UNREGRESSED (no flag: 0 crashes, full 25s, attract spin). New flag REX_TEXSEQ; new map g_texObjToBlock.

**⇒ NEXT (cont.56):** decode the texture-HANDLE structure (0x0610FEB0): find the field holding the Xenos fetch
constant / GPU base (0xA4xxxxxx) so handle→decoded-texture resolves (probe more handle words; cross-ref the
CreateTexture object layout). THEN (the actual fix) the cont.54 draw-time flush → command-buffer gap: find where the
real per-frame draw+flush stream lives and make variant A execute it (per-draw SET_CONSTANT inline) = visible menu.

## cont.56 (2026-06-06, /loop) — ⭐CRACKED the per-draw texture DATA PATH: the menu's textures ARE the working buffers (handle+0x1C = Xenos fetch constant → 0xA2-0xA3 base)

Decoded the texture-HANDLE structure (cont.55's pending resolution). Dumped handle 0x0610FEB0 (gdb-style via GLD32):
the **Xenos 2D texture FETCH CONSTANT is at handle+0x1C** — d0=GLD32(h+0x1C) bits[1:0]=2 (TEXTURE), d1=+0x20 base in
bits[31:12], d2=+0x24 width-1[12:0]/height-1[25:13], format=d1[5:0], endian=d1[6:7]. (My first scan missed it: the
base is in the **0xA2xxxxxx-0xA3xxxxxx WORKING-BUFFER** range, not the 0xA4-0xA5 GPU window I scanned.)

**MEASURED (attract, REX_TEXSEQ, per-draw fetch-constant decode):** the menu binds, per draw, REAL working-buffer
textures —
  - 0xA2D96000 fmt6 584×198 = the **South Park logo** (handle embeds path "memory://…#Graphics\s_p_lo…")
  - 0xA2F25000 fmt6 374×446 = the **Comedy Central logo** (exactly cont.44's 0xA2F25000 working buffer!)
  - 0xA337D000 fmt2 256×256 = a UI texture
These are cont.44's decoded LINEAR 0xA2-0xA3 buffers ⇒ **the menu's per-draw textures literally ARE the working
buffers** (the user's "render the real menu from working buffers"). Every menu draw is now resolvable to decodable
texture data (base+dims+format from handle+0x1C; data in the working buffers; decode via cont.44).

⇒ the per-draw texture DATA PATH is CLOSED: SetTexture(handle) → handle+0x1C fetch constant → 0xA2xxxxxx working-buffer
base + dims + format → decode → the texture. (REX_TEXSEQ now logs the per-draw texture descriptors.) Default boot
UNREGRESSED (0 crashes, full 22s, attract spin).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.57): the BINDING (toward a VISIBLE textured menu).** variant A executes the draws (cont.45) but the
fetch slots are 0x0 (the cont.54 flush gap). Now that I have each draw's fetch constant at SetTexture time, attempt:
maintain an ordered QUEUE of per-draw fetch constants (from the sub_821BEC00 hook, real handles only) and at each
ExecutePM4 DRAW_INDX dequeue + inject it (WriteGpuReg the texture fetch slot) before the draw — relying on the
cont.23 count-correlation (SetTexture order == executed-draw order). If the orders align, the menu draws bind their
real working-buffer textures → first textured menu. Risk: SetTexture/draw correlation (stage-clears, redundant sets,
per-frame boundaries) — verify the counts align first.

## cont.57 (2026-06-06, /loop) — ⭐⭐MAJOR REFRAMING: the per-draw textures ARE BOUND in the executed draws (cont.45's "tex=0x0" was a FILTER ARTIFACT). The gap is the RENDERER decoding+displaying them, not the binding.

Was about to build the queue-inject "workaround" (cont.56 NEXT). First widened REX_TEXBIND (it only flagged bases in
0x04-0x06/EDRAM; the menu textures are elsewhere) and added the slot0 texture-base (d1) to the [esdraw] diag. The
result OVERTURNS the 30-continuation "per-draw textures not bound / SetTexture stubbed (cont.23-24-45 dead-end)"
premise:

**The executed menu draws ARE bound to the real working-buffer textures.** [esdraw] at attract (REX_EXECSEGS):
  - #1 op=0x22 prim=4 slot0 d0=05004802 **type=2 texD1=02D96086 → base 0xA2D96000** (South Park logo) | vtx slot1
  - #2 op=0x22 prim=13 slot0 d0=02000002 **type=2 texD1=0337D002 → base 0xA337D000** (UI 256²) | vtx slot1
  - across the frame: 0xA2D96000 (logo, 11 draws) + 0xA337D000 (UI, 6 draws), both type=2, real working-buffer bases.

So slot0 of the executed draws holds a REAL Xenos texture fetch constant (type=2) whose **d1 base = the cont.56
working buffer** (0xA2D96000 logo / 0xA337D000 UI). **cont.45's "sprite/text tex=0x0" was a measurement artifact:**
the base is stored in the PHYSICAL form 0x02xxxxxx (d1=0x02D96086; mirror 0xA2D96000), which sat BELOW the 0x04-0x06
filter that REX_TEXBIND/REX_SCENE used — so every "no textures bound" measurement (cont.36/45) silently excluded the
actual bases. Also: the SetTexture stream count (48, capped) == the executed-draw count (48, capped); the textures
correlate to the draws inherently (they're IN the draws' fetch constants).

⇒ **the per-draw texture binding WORKS end to end** (title sets it → it's in variant A's executed buffer → slot0 d1
= the working-buffer texture). The remaining gap is purely **variant A's RENDERER**: it must, per textured draw, read
slot0 d1, decode the 0xA2xxxxxx LINEAR working-buffer texture (cont.44 decodes these), and bind+sample it in Vulkan.
cont.45's renderer reported tex=0x0 because of the same 0x04-0x06 filter. Default boot UNREGRESSED (0 crashes, 22s).
Changes: widened REX_TEXBIND filter; [esdraw] now prints slot0 d1 (texture base).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.58 — the VISIBLE MENU):** fix variant A's renderer (vulkan_render.cpp REX_RENDER/REX_EXECSEGS draw
path) to use slot0 d1 per draw: read the fetch constant (d0 type=2, d1 base 0x02/0xA2xxxxxx, d2 dims, format), decode
the LINEAR working-buffer texture (cont.44 path: linear 8888/format), UploadTexture, bind for that draw's vkCmdDraw.
The textures + geometry are already there — this is the last step to a real textured menu from the working buffers.
First: find where the renderer reads the per-draw texture (the 0x04-0x06 filter to widen to 0x02-0x06/0xA0-0xA6).

## cont.58 (2026-06-06, /loop) — ⭐DECODED the real menu textures from the working buffers via the LIVE per-draw fetch constant (image sent). Widened the render-path texture filter (0x02-0x06).

Acted on cont.57's NEXT. The render-path texture filter (REX_TEXBIND/REX_TEXDECODE, kernel.cpp:1412) only caught
bases in 0x04-0x06/0xA0-0xA6 — but the menu textures' fetch-constant base is the PHYSICAL form 0x02xxxxxx
(d1=0x02D96086 → 0x02D96000; mirror 0xA2D96000). Widened the low bound to **0x02000000** (vertex pools at
0x01xxxxxx stay excluded). Now REX_TEXBIND catches them and REX_TEXDECODE decodes them.

**RESULT (REX_EXECSEGS + REX_TEXBIND + REX_TEXDECODE, attract): the real menu textures decode from the working
buffers via the LIVE executed fetch constant** (the cont.57 slot0 type=2 draws). The [texbind] now shows, per
executed textured draw, the real base + the FULL fetch constant + populated data:
  - A2D96000 256×256 fmt6 endian2 nz=64/64 — logo text
  - A2F25000 256×256 fmt6 nz=64/64 — South Park cityscape/buildings art (the 0xA2F25000 working buffer, cont.44)
  - A2E12000 / A2FD1000 ("SOUTH PARK"/"THQ" font atlas) / A2FCD000 — populated UI textures
(plus empty-binds A337D000/A2D76000/… nz=0, and the big tiled 0xA4-0xA5 GPU-window sheets 669×6185/1214×6006.)
Decoded 5 populated fmt6 256×256 menu textures → PPM → montage PNG, **viewed + sent to the user**: recognizable
real menu art (logo, cityscape, SOUTH PARK/THQ font). Some (logo/font) have horizontal scanline/pitch artifacts
(the stored pitch/height likely differs from the 256×256 d2 — refine dims in cont.59); the cityscape decodes clean.

⇒ the FULL path is proven end-to-end: executed menu draw → slot0 d1 fetch constant (cont.57) → 0x02/0xA2xxxxxx
working-buffer base → rex_tex::DecodeGuestToRGBA → real menu texture. "Render the real menu from working buffers"
is confirmed at the texture level — the textures ARE the working buffers and decode correctly. Default boot
UNREGRESSED (0 crashes, full 20s, attract spin). Note d2 dims: the EXECUTED fetch constant says 256×256
(d2=001FE0FF), vs the handle's 584×198 (cont.56) — use the executed fetch constant's dims for rendering.

**⇒ NEXT (cont.59 — the COMPOSED visible menu):** wire the live render to draw each textured draw with its
working-buffer texture: per textured DRAW_INDX (slot0 type=2), decode slot0 d1's texture (this path), carve the
draw's geometry+UV (vtxSlot=1 vbase), UploadTexture, and draw that group with that texture (extend the textured
pipeline g_texPipe / SubmitTexturedGeometry to per-draw {verts, texture}). Capture (REX_RENDER_SHOT). Refine the
scanline/pitch (try height/2 or the real pitch) for the logo/font textures.

## cont.59 (2026-06-06, /loop) — the composed menu is blocked by the GEOMETRY, not the textures: the executed segment has bound textures (cont.57) but NO valid vertex source (the cont.34 placeholder program). Textures are the solved half.

Started the per-draw textured render (cont.58 NEXT). Checked the per-draw GEOMETRY first (cont.22-23 flagged the
sprite/text vertex pools as "soup") — DECISIVE: the executed textured draws have NO usable geometry:
  - [esidx]: every textured draw reads idxBase=0xA0006000 **sz=0x80000000 (the not-ready sentinel)**, idx=[0,0,0,0],
    and the verts at vbase read **(0.0, 0.0)**.
  - [esvf]: the VS's own vfetch decodes to **slot 0 (the TEXTURE slot, type=2)** with base 0xA5004800 (font atlas) /
    0xA2000000, off=0, v0=(0,0) — i.e. the executed segment's VS is a PLACEHOLDER that fetches from the texture
    slot, not a real vertex buffer. esdraw's slot-1 "vertex" base (0xA018A244) has words=2753285 (absurd) = garbage.

⇒ the executed segment (device+13568) is the cont.34 PLACEHOLDER program: it has the real per-draw TEXTURES bound
(cont.57, slot0 d1 = the 0xA2 working buffers) but a placeholder VS + not-ready/garbage index+vertex buffers. The
REAL menu geometry is in the title's dynamic VBs (e.g. the text VB 0xA022FFF0 that sub_821F8E60 fills, cont.47) which
the placeholder segment does NOT read. So the composed menu AT REAL POSITIONS is blocked by the GEOMETRY (the cont.34
real-frame / cont.22-23 vertex-source wall) — NOT by the textures (decoded + bound, the solved half, cont.56-58).

**⇒ Honest session state (cont.52-59):** the "render the real menu FROM WORKING BUFFERS" directive is SOLVED at the
texture level — the menu's per-draw textures ARE the 0xA2-0xA3 working buffers, decoded + bound + shown (cont.56-58,
image sent). The remaining wall is the COMPOSITION's geometry: variant A executes a placeholder segment (textures
bound, geometry not), and the real menu frame (which reads the dynamic-VB geometry) isn't executed = the cont.34
A↔B / deep renderer wall (cont.21-49 territory, multi-week).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.60):** two tracks — (a) VISIBLE-NOW (no geometry): render the decoded menu textures LIVE in variant A's
Vulkan (contact-sheet / reuse cont.37 REX_HUDSHEET but from the live working-buffer fetch constants) → proves the
working-buffer→live-render path on-screen (capture+send); (b) the real composition = attack the geometry — find the
real menu draws' vertex source (the dynamic VBs 0xA022FFF0+, cont.47) and either read+compose them with the per-draw
textures, or get the real frame executed (cont.34). Track (b) is the deep wall; (a) is the tangible interim render.

## cont.60 (2026-06-06, /loop) — ⭐VARIANT A RENDERS THE REAL MENU TEXTURES LIVE from the working buffers (REX_MENULIVE; image sent). On-screen proof of the working-buffer→Vulkan path; geometry/composition still the cont.34 wall.

Did track (a) (cont.59 NEXT). New REX_MENULIVE path: kernel.cpp's REX_TEXDECODE (which decodes each per-draw menu
texture from the 0xA2 working buffers, cont.58) now also calls the new **rex_render::BlitMenuCell** to composite each
decoded texture into a render-side 4×2 contact sheet (1024×512, dedup by GPU base); the render thread (PresentOnce)
uploads it (LoadMenuSheetLive, once ≥3 cells) and draws it via the existing textured pipeline (g_texPipe). Needs
REX_RENDER + REX_MENUTEST (the textured present path) + REX_EXECSEGS + REX_TEXBIND + REX_TEXDECODE.

**RESULT (captured from the live swapchain, frame 886): variant A's OWN Vulkan renderer draws the REAL menu textures
live** — the 4×2 cells are the per-draw menu textures decoded via the LIVE fetch constant: top-mid = the South Park
cityscape/buildings (clean, recognizable), top-left = logo text (scanline artifact), bottom-left = a UI orb, others
empty/dark (textures that decoded to black or weren't populated at capture). 8 cells blitted (g_menuCells capped 8).
PNG captured + VIEWED + SENT to the user. This is the first LIVE render (in variant A's renderer, not a PPM dump,
cont.58) of the real menu art from the working buffers — the working-buffer→decode→UploadTexture→Vulkan path proven
on-screen end-to-end. Default boot UNREGRESSED (0 crashes, full 20s, attract spin); all changes gated behind
REX_MENULIVE / the REX flags.

⇒ the "render the real menu FROM WORKING BUFFERS" directive is now demonstrated on-screen at the TEXTURE level (the
real menu textures render live in variant A). The COMPOSITION (real per-draw positions) remains the cont.34/22-23
GEOMETRY wall (cont.59: the executed segment is a placeholder with no valid vertex source).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.61):** (a) refine the texture decode (the logo/font scanline/pitch artifact — try the real surface
pitch / height) for cleaner cells; (b) the real composition = the geometry (cont.34): find the real menu draws'
vertex source (dynamic VBs 0xA022FFF0+, cont.47) to place the textures, or break the cont.34 A↔B so the real frame
(geometry+textures) executes. New: rex_render::BlitMenuCell + LoadMenuSheetLive + REX_MENULIVE.

## cont.61 (2026-06-06, /loop) — geometry source still blocked (cont.47 VB empty); the logo/font SCANLINE artifact is a per-texture PITCH mismatch (pitch=512 makes the logo readable). Texture-polish + geometry-block confirmation.

Two tracks from cont.60:
- (b) GEOMETRY: checked the cont.47 dynamic VB 0xA022FFF0 at the textured draws (gdb, vbcheck.gdb) — it's **all
  zeros** at SetTexture time. So 0xA022FFF0 is NOT the geometry source for the logo/cityscape draws (it's the text
  renderer's VB, empty here). The geometry source for the textured menu draws remains unfindable (the cont.22-23/34/59
  wall stands; the executed segment is a placeholder, the live VB guess is empty).
- (a) TEXTURE POLISH: the cont.58/60 logo/font scanline artifact is a ROW-PITCH mismatch. Experiment (REX_PITCHTEST,
  re-decode at pitch ∈ {2w, w/2, 512, 1024}): the logo A2D96000 at **pitch=512** is READABLE yellow text (vs heavy
  scanlines at pitch=256=width). So the real row pitch ≠ width for some textures, and it VARIES per texture: the
  cityscape A2F25000 is clean at pitch=256, the logo A2D96000 needs ~512. ⇒ a global pitch won't work; the per-texture
  pitch must come from the fetch-constant d0 field — NOT yet cracked (d0: A2D96000=0x05004802 [needs 512], A2F25000=
  0x03004802 [256 clean], A2E12000=0x07004802, A2FD1000=0x00804802; bits[26:24]=5/3/7/0 don't map cleanly to 512/256
  yet). Diagnostic only; REX_MENULIVE unchanged (left at pitch=width). Default boot UNREGRESSED.

**⇒ Honest session state (cont.52-61):** "render the real menu FROM WORKING BUFFERS" is delivered at the TEXTURE
level — the menu's per-draw textures ARE the 0xA2 working buffers, decoded + bound + rendered LIVE in variant A's
Vulkan (cont.60, image sent); cont.61 shows they can be made cleaner (per-texture pitch). The COMPOSED menu (real
per-draw positions) is the remaining wall = the cont.34/22-23 GEOMETRY (the textured draws' vertex source is
unfindable — executed segment is a placeholder, the live VBs don't hold it). That's the deep multi-week renderer
build (cont.21-49 territory); /loop iterations narrow it but haven't cracked it.

**⇒ NEXT (cont.62):** crack the d0 pitch field (decode each menu texture at the d0-derived pitch → clean cells →
cleaner live render); OR the geometry (the real composition): trace the textured draws' ACTUAL vertex source (hook
sub_821F8E60 directly if it's directly-called, to read the renderer's VB pointer + the fill), or apply the prod-oracle
to the cont.34 A↔B (why the real frame with geometry isn't executed). New diag: REX_PITCHTEST; tool vbcheck.gdb.

---

## cont.62 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job рендери реальное меню из working-буферов") — ⭐SCANLINE ARTIFACT SOLVED: non-power-of-2 row pitch; 3 boot splashes decoded CLEAN

The cont.58/60/61 "scanline + horizontal-repeat" artifact on the menu textures — open for 5 continuations and
guessed to be tiling / a per-texture d0-pitch hack (cont.61 thought pitch=512 for the logo) — is now **fully root-caused
and fixed**. It was a **non-power-of-2 LINEAR ROW PITCH** that the d2 width field (256) does not carry.

**Investigation (all measured, not guessed):**
- Rebuilt with cont.61's `(d0>>25)&0x7F ×256` guess (pitch 512 for the logo): logo STILL scanlined (zoomed). Tried
  `tiled=1`: full checkerboard scramble (worse) ⇒ the fetch constant's `tiled=0` is correct, NOT a tiling problem.
- Dumped 2 MiB of each menu buffer (`/tmp/raw_*.bin`) and brute-forced the pitch OFFLINE in Python (no rebuild/guess).
  First metric (adjacent-row difference) found 320/384/448 — but those are the **content widths**, and decoding there
  STILL scanlined for the logo/scene: the metric is fooled because the half-pitch interleaves matching rows
  (background-dominated). Decoding at the DOUBLED pitch with full width revealed the truth:
  - **A2D96000 @ pitch=width=640** → CLEAN **"SOUTH PARK DIGITAL STUDIOS"** (Cartman portrait + logo). The earlier
    "SOUTH PARK with scanlines" at 320 was the right half of this 640-wide image, row-interleaved.
  - **A2F25000 @ 384** → CLEAN **COMEDY CENTRAL** logo. (Decoding at 768 shows TWO logos side-by-side = the 384-wide
    image's even/odd rows split into halves ⇒ proves the fundamental is 384, not 768.)
  - **A2E12000 @ 896** → CLEAN **"doublesix"** (the developer studio) glowing logo.
- These are the title's **boot studio splash screens**, decoded straight from its own runtime working buffers.

**The formula (universal, principled — not a fit):** the true pitch = the documented Xenos fetch-constant **d0 field
bits[30:22] << 5** (Xenia `xe_gpu_texture_fetch_t.pitch`, texels). 20<<5=640 ✓, 12<<5=384 ✓, 28<<5=896 ✓ — all three.
The surfaces are full-width (no right padding), so pitch == width; the d2 "width" (256) is simply not the real width.

**Fix (kernel.cpp, REX_TEXDECODE block ~1452):** for `!tiled && !IsCompressed(fmt) && w_>=64`, set
`d.width = d.pitchTexels = ((d0>>22)&0x1FF)<<5` when that exceeds the d2 width. `rex_texture.h`: removed the
dead-end `DetectLinearPitch` (the adjacent-row-diff auto-detector found the HALF pitch — padding rows match — and the
uniform-row-fraction variant was too noisy; the documented formula is correct and needs no runtime detection).

**Result:** REX_MENULIVE now renders the three splashes CLEAN on variant A's own Vulkan swapchain (live capture
`/tmp/varianta_menu.ppm`), and the standalone decodes are pixel-clean. Two images sent (live render + clean montage).

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** the pitchfix is entirely under `REX_TEXDECODE` (null in default boot); the rex_texture.h
edit only removed an unused inline function. Verified default boot: 0 crash/abort/segfault markers, normal
fence-forward render activity at the end.

**⚠ Honest limits:** (1) the d2 HEIGHT (256) is also wrong — COMEDY CENTRAL is ~384×512 and is cut at the bottom at
height 256 (SP/doublesix splashes are complete at 256); recovering the real height is a small separate step.
(2) This is the TEXTURE half — now clean. The COMPOSED menu (real per-draw positions) is still the cont.34/22-23/59
GEOMETRY wall (the textured draws' vertex source is unfindable; VB 0xA022FFF0 is empty cont.61; the executed segment
is a placeholder). That remains the deep multi-week build.

**⇒ NEXT (cont.63):** (a) the splash HEIGHT (crack the fc height field or decode taller → full COMEDY CENTRAL);
(b) the composition GEOMETRY — the one remaining wall: hook `sub_821F8E60` DIRECTLY (the cont.55 trick used on
sub_821BEC00) to read the renderer's real VB pointer + fill, OR apply the prod-oracle to the cont.34 A↔B (execute the
real frame WITH geometry instead of the placeholder).

## cont.63 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep until 10:00 MSK) — ⭐SPLASH DECODE COMPLETED: real handle dims (height + content width); COMEDY CENTRAL now full

cont.62 fixed the splash WIDTH via the d0 pitch field but left the HEIGHT as the executed draw's 256×256 placeholder
(COMEDY CENTRAL cut at row 256). **Root:** the EXECUTED draw's fetch constant carries a 256×256 PLACEHOLDER size
(cont.59 — the executed segment is a placeholder), while the title's texture HANDLE (sub_821BEC00, handle+0x1C,
cont.56) carries the REAL content dims. Measured this run ([texseq]): **A2D96000 584×198, A2F25000 374×446,
A2E12000 875×314** — the handle's d2 holds the true dims, unlike the executed d2 (all 256×256).

**FIX (kernel.cpp):** (1) a base→(w,h) map `g_texDimsByBase`, populated in the `sub_821BEC00` hook (gated
`s_capdims = REX_TEXSEQ||REX_TEXDECODE`) from the handle's handle+0x1C fetch constant. (2) In REX_TEXDECODE, look up
the executed base and use the handle HEIGHT (extends CC 256→446, crops SP 256→198) and — when the d0 pitch field gave
a real STRIDE — the handle content WIDTH (crops the right padding: SP 640→584, CC 384→374, doublesix 896→875); the
pitch stays the row stride. `[dimfix]` logs each.

**RESULT** (REX_RENDER+MENULIVE+TEXBIND+TEXDECODE+TEXSEQ+EXECSEGS + run-base, `timeout -s KILL -k 5 60`): the three
boot splashes decode as tight, full images — **SP DIGITAL STUDIOS 584×198** (Cartman+logo), **COMEDY CENTRAL 374×446**
(FULL — the cityscape mark + "COMEDY CENTRAL" text, no longer cut at 256), **doublesix 875×314**. Montage
`/tmp/cont63_splash_final.png` (viewed). The texture-decode half is now fully correct (pitch = row stride, handle =
content dims).

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** plain headless boot = 393,211 lines, 0 real crash markers (the 1 grep hit is the benign
`[stub] ExTerminateThread`), `[dimfix]` absent (gated code dormant), normal fence-forward at the end. All changes are
behind REX_TEXDECODE/REX_TEXSEQ.

**⇒ NEXT (cont.64):** the texture half is DONE; attack the remaining wall = the **COMPOSITION GEOMETRY**
(cont.34/22-23/59). Plan: hook `sub_821F8E60` DIRECTLY (the cont.55 `sub_821BEC00` trick) to read the renderer's real
VB pointer + vertex fill at the textured menu draws (cont.61 found the dynamic VB 0xA022FFF0 EMPTY at those draws — the
real geometry source is elsewhere). First verify a direct override of `sub_821F8E60` FIRES (gdb; cont.55 lesson: only
directly-called fns fire, vtable/dispatch-table calls bypass a weak-alias override). New: `g_texDimsByBase`, `[dimfix]`.

## cont.64 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — ⭐⭐GEOMETRY FOUND: the textured IMAGE draws are SCREEN-SPACE quads (sprite renderer lr=0x82205114), directly renderable; cont.62's "hook sub_821F8E60" targeted the wrong (TEXT) renderer

The cont.22–61 "the textured menu draws' vertex source is unfindable / placeholder / needs the A↔B deep build" wall is
substantially CRACKED for the IMAGE draws. New `REX_DRAWCAP` (kernel.cpp): correlate each dynamic-VB fill
(`sub_8242BF10`) with the texture bound just before it (`g_lastTexBase`, set in the `sub_821BEC00` hook on the same
guest thread) — the texture↔geometry pairing cont.23's vert capture lacked (the texture side was only cracked in
cont.56–57).

**MEASURED (REX_DRAWCAP, headless, run-base) — TWO distinct renderers:**
- **lr=0x821F90B0 (`sub_821F8E60`) = the TEXT renderer:** vc=252 (~63 glyphs×4), font atlas 0xA337D000, NORMALIZED
  uv[0,1], small top-left box (pos[16.5..458.5, -0.5..76.5]) = LOCAL space (what cont.23 found needs the deferred
  transform). ⇒ cont.62's NEXT-b "hook sub_821F8E60 for the real VB ptr" targeted the TEXT renderer, NOT the images.
- **lr=0x82205114 (a SEPARATE sprite renderer) = the IMAGE draws:** SCREEN-SPACE position-only quads. Decoded raw:
  - SP logo (A2D96000): 12 floats = **6 (x,y) verts, stride-8** = (348,261)(932,261)(932,459) + (348,261)(932,459)(348,459)
    = **2 triangles**, rect **584×198 CENTERED** on 1280×720 — EXACTLY the logo's cont.63 content dims.
  - doublesix (A2E12000): rect **875×314 centered** = exactly its cont.63 dims.
  - a full-coverage quad (0,0)-(1768,1043), 4 verts, with various textures (a background/overscan element).
  - **No UV in the buffer** (stride 8, pos.xy only) ⇒ implicit **FULL-TEXTURE UV** (the texture IS the sprite, 1:1).

**⇒ DECISIVE:** the textured IMAGE menu draws are SCREEN-SPACE (1280×720) quads at the texture's native size, captured
LIVE on the guest thread, with the texture correlated. They are **DIRECTLY RENDERABLE** — no deferred transform (that
applies only to the TEXT renderer). This overturns cont.61's "vertex source unfindable" (cont.61 checked the executed
placeholder + the text VB 0xA022FFF0 at SetTexture time — both the wrong place/time) and narrows the wall.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (gated REX_DRAWCAP; plain headless: 240k lines, 0 real crashes, `[drawcap]` dormant).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.65, COMPOSED MENU AT REAL POSITIONS):** render each image draw as a screen-space textured quad —
capture its 6 verts (lr=0x82205114) → NDC (x/640−1, 1−y/360), bind `g_lastTexBase` decoded via cont.63 (handle dims),
full UV (0,0)-(1,1) → draw per-draw (extend cont.60 REX_MENULIVE / g_texPipe to per-draw {screen quad, texture}).
Result = the real boot splashes (logo/doublesix centered) and, when the menu's image draws fire, the composed menu
images at real positions. The TEXT (`sub_821F8E60`, local-space) remains a separate sub-problem (its deferred
transform). New: `REX_DRAWCAP`, `g_lastTexBase`, `[drawcap]`.

## cont.65 (2026-06-06, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — ⭐⭐⭐REAL FRAMES AT REAL POSITIONS: variant A reconstructs the title's boot-splash frames (decoded texture composited at the sprite renderer's screen rect)

cont.64 found the image draws are screen-space sprite quads (lr=0x82205114). cont.65 RENDERS them: composite each
decoded texture (cont.63) onto a black 1280×720 frame at the captured screen rect = the title's REAL boot-splash
frame at its REAL position.

**IMPLEMENTATION (kernel.cpp):** the texture-handle info (sub_821BEC00 hook) now stores the full decode params
(fmt/endian/tiled/pitch + content w/h) per base (`g_texDimsByBase` extended). `REX_DRAWCAP`, on the GUEST thread at
each image draw (sub_8242BF10 from lr=0x82205114), captures the screen rect AND has the texture (g_lastTexBase) — so
it decodes the texture (`ComposeRealFrame`, reusing the cont.63 decode: pitch=stride, handle=content dims) and blits
it onto a black 1280×720 frame at the rect, one PPM per base. (First tried compositing in the executed-segment
REX_TEXDECODE path, but that decodes once per base and races ahead of the rect capture — CC composed, SP/d6 missed;
the guest-thread path has rect+texture both ready.)

**RESULT** (REX_DRAWCAP, headless, run-base): three real boot-splash frames, each CENTERED (screen center 640,360):
- **SP DIGITAL STUDIOS** (A2D96000) 584×198 @ (348,261)
- **COMEDY CENTRAL** (A2F25000) 374×446 @ (453,137)
- **doublesix** (A2E12000) 875×314 @ (203,203)

Montage `/tmp/cont65_splashframes.png` (viewed). The full pipeline — working buffer → decode (cont.63) → composite at
the sprite renderer's screen rect (cont.64) → real frame — is proven end-to-end. The positions ARE the title's (from
its own sprite verts); all three centered = boot splashes.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (gated REX_DRAWCAP; 245k lines, 0 real crashes, `[frame]`/`[drawcap]` dormant).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.66):** (a) LIVE on-screen render of the real-position composite (extend cont.60 REX_MENULIVE to use
the real-position frame, not the contact sheet); (b) the actual MENU = a PERSISTENT accumulator frame (all
simultaneous image draws blitted into ONE 1280×720 frame, vs these per-base splash frames) — reach the attract/menu
(input nav past the intro, or the attract loop) → the composed menu/attract scene at real positions. The TEXT
(sub_821F8E60, local-space) still needs its deferred transform (separate). New: `ComposeRealFrame`, `g_texScreenRect`,
`[frame]`; `g_texDimsByBase` extended with decode params. ⚠note: the dev shell is zsh — `rm glob*` aborts on no-match
(use `find -delete` or `*(N)`).

## cont.66 (2026-06-06/07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — multi-element frame accumulator built (VdSwap-snapshotted); FINDING: the composed menu now needs the per-draw UVs (atlas sprites) + the text transform, NOT more image work

Built the persistent 1280×720 frame ACCUMULATOR (`REX_FCOMPOSE`): every sprite image draw (lr=0x82205114) blits its
decoded texture (cached, `g_decCache`) into `g_frameBuf` at its screen rect (alpha-keyed); `VdSwap` (the guest frame
present) snapshots `g_frameBuf` → PPM and clears it. Goal: reconstruct MULTI-element scenes (the menu), not just
cont.65's per-base splash.

**VALIDATED:** composes correctly — headless frame 000 = the SP DIGITAL STUDIOS splash (same as cont.65, via the
accumulator). But the passive run reaches only single-element splashes + VdSwap is sparse headless (2 dirty frames).

**REX_SKIPINTRO** (START injection) advances much further (162 assets, 30 frames), but the composed frames stay
SPARSE, and the decisive reason is a real finding:
- The SPLASH phase = dedicated-texture, FULL-UV sprites (logo etc.) → rendered correctly (cont.65).
- The MENU/attract phase's sprite draws are ALL the **UI ATLAS 0xA337D000 (256²)** drawn as **FULL-SCREEN quads**
  (0,0)-(1768,1043), repeated per frame (dests A0230C80/CA0/B9480/B94A0 cycling), with **PER-DRAW UVs (atlas
  sub-rects)** — which the position-only fill (stride-8, no UV) does NOT carry, so they can't be placed/cropped (a
  full-UV path would just stretch the whole atlas). Plus **19 TEXT draws** (sub_821F8E60, lr=0x821F90B0, local-space).

**⇒ the composed MENU is gated on TWO missing pieces, NOT more image work:** (1) the per-draw UVs for the atlas
sprites (where each atlas sub-rect comes from — a separate UV stream / fixed-function); (2) the TEXT renderer's
deferred World+Proj transform (the cont.23 problem). The dedicated-texture images are solved (cont.65). ⚠ REX_SKIPINTRO
also drives toward Level 1, not a clean menu stop — cleanly reaching the main menu needs input timing.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (gated REX_FCOMPOSE; 207k lines, 0 real crashes, `[fcompose]`/`[frame]` dormant).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.67):** find the menu sprites' PER-DRAW UVs (the atlas sub-rect source — likely a second VB stream the
sprite renderer fills, or texcoords set via a different path) so the atlas-based menu renders — OR the TEXT transform
(cont.23: pair the local-space glyph verts with the World+Proj set later). New: `AccumulateFrame`,
`SnapshotFrameOnSwap`, `g_frameBuf`, `g_decCache`, `REX_FCOMPOSE`, `[fcompose]`.

## cont.67 (2026-06-07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — investigation: the sprite path is IMAGE-only (splashes); the menu TEXT is the lr=0x821F90B0 local-space path, gated on the deferred transform (the cont.34 A↔B wall). cont.66's "menu = atlas quads" was a 48-cap artifact.

Followed up cont.66's "the menu needs the atlas per-draw UVs." Findings (all measured):
- The sprite fill is **sub_822050B8** (ppc_recomp.23, a generic dynamic-VB fill: alloc sub_821C48B0 → one memcpy
  sub_8242BF10; the per-format vertex STRIDE comes from a table at **0x820A8E60** indexed by r4). It is called
  INDIRECTLY (no direct `bl` sites) so a weak override won't fire (cont.55) — capturing r4 needs gdb at 0x822050B8.
- The cont.66 `[drawcap]` log was CAPPED at 48 and entirely consumed by the INTRO phase, so cont.66's "the menu
  sprites are all the UI atlas 0xA337D000 full-screen quads" was an INTRO artifact, not the menu. Raised the cap to 600.
- With the cap at 600 + REX_SKIPINTRO: the sprite renderer (lr=0x82205114) draws almost entirely FULL-SCREEN bg quads
  (0,0)-(1768,1043) + only 2 small non-bg sprites (A2D96000 the SP logo, A2FD1000 64×64). ⇒ the menu's rich content is
  **NOT** in the image-sprite path.
- The accumulator (cont.66) DID capture frames of recognizable glyphs (MICROSOFT / copyright text) from per-word 0xA2
  glyph textures (A2D76000/A2FE9000/…, varying per run) — so legal/title TEXT does render as small textured sprites,
  but the layout is scattered and the texture set is timing-dependent.
- The real menu TEXT is the **lr=0x821F90B0** path (sub_821F8E60): glyphs with NORMALIZED uv (font atlas) but in LOCAL
  space (pos[16.5..458.5, -0.5..76.5]) needing the deferred World+Proj transform — which cont.23 measured = zeros at
  fill time (set later in the segment variant A doesn't execute = the **cont.34 A↔B wall**).

**⇒ HONEST CONCLUSION:** the IMAGE elements render at real positions (splashes, cont.65); the menu TEXT is local-space
and gated on the deferred transform = the cont.34 A↔B deep wall (multi-week). The composed interactive menu needs that
wall cracked OR the title's text positions reconstructed another way. Default boot UNREGRESSED (gated; cap-raise only).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.68):** CONSOLIDATE the achievable on-screen — render the cont.65 real-position splash composite LIVE on
variant A's Vulkan swapchain (extend cont.60 REX_MENULIVE to the real-position 1280×720 frame, not the contact sheet)
+ capture = on-screen proof of the real boot splash. (The menu TEXT remains the cont.34 A↔B wall — a separate deep
effort.) Tools for the text route: gdb at 0x822050B8 (capture r4/stride/verts) + the cont.34 segment-execution work.

## cont.68 (2026-06-07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — ⭐REX_TEXDUMP decodes the title's full BOUND-texture inventory: the real menu/level-select assets (character portraits, text strings) exist and decode

New `REX_TEXDUMP` (kernel.cpp sub_821BEC00 hook): decode each distinct BOUND texture once (guest-side, any 0xA2–0xB0
base) → PPM. The executed-segment REX_TEXDECODE only sees textures bound in the replayed segments; the menu/text draws
bind their textures on the guest thread, which never reach that path. With REX_SKIPINTRO (reaches the menu/level
assets), it dumped **19 distinct bound textures**:
- **CHARACTER PORTRAITS 215×110 fmt6:** Cartman (ADB63000), Stan (ADB9B000), Kyle (ADBB7000) — recognizable, the real
  menu/level-select character art.
- **PRE-RENDERED TEXT STRINGS 256×256 FMT_8 (fmt2):** A337D000, A2FD9000 ("…/THIS GAME…/X360…" = legal/copyright text
  baked into textures), A2D76000, A2FE9000, ACE54000, ACE78000, B09E2000.
- the splash logos (A2D96000 SP, A2E12000 doublesix, A2F25000 CC), 40×40 icons (ACE74000/AD8BA000/B09CC000/B09CF000),
  a 256×64 banner (B09D2000).
Montage `/tmp/cont68_uitex.png` (viewed) — Stan/Kyle/Cartman + the text-string atlases.

**⇒ the menu's real assets EXIST and DECODE cleanly** (incl. the FMT_8 single-channel text atlases). This reframes
cont.66/67: the "scattered glyphs" were these pre-rendered text-string textures; the menu has rich content (portraits,
text). The remaining gap is their DRAW POSITIONS — the portraits are 0xAD/0xB0 base, OUTSIDE cont.65's 0xA2
ComposeRealFrame filter, so they're decoded but not yet placed.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (gated REX_TEXDUMP; 172k lines, 0 real crashes).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.69):** widen ComposeRealFrame/AccumulateFrame to the 0xAC–0xB0 menu textures + capture their sprite
draw rects (the portraits/panels' positions) → compose the real menu/level-select screen (character portraits at
their real positions). New: `REX_TEXDUMP`, `[texdump]`.

## cont.69 (2026-06-07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — widening the composite to 0xAC–0xB0 WON'T compose the menu: its content goes through the TEXT renderer (transform-walled) + non-sprite paths. Points to the EXECSEGS-transform text render.

cont.68 decoded the menu assets (portraits, text); cont.69 checked HOW to place them. New `REX_DRAWCAP` `[menudraw]`
log (fills whose last-bound texture is 0xAC–0xB0, independent of the VB-range/cap). With REX_SKIPINTRO:
- The menu TEXT atlases (e.g. ACE54000) are drawn by the **TEXT renderer** (lr=0x821F90B0, sub_821F8E60) in LOCAL
  space (v0=(0.5,21.5,…)) — the transform-walled path (cont.23/34), NOT the screen-space sprite renderer.
- The CHARACTER PORTRAITS (ADB63000 etc.) do NOT appear in any sub_8242BF10 fill — bound (cont.68 SetTexture) but
  their draw frames are transient/missed (REX_SKIPINTRO drives toward Level 1, past the level-select).
- The other `[menudraw]` hits are descriptor/data copies (dest 0x00/0x06/0x700F, not geometry).
⇒ widening cont.65's 0xA2 ComposeRealFrame filter to 0xAC–0xB0 would NOT place the menu — its content is
text-renderer + non-capturable, not simple sprites. The real menu composition is gated on the TEXT-renderer transform
(cont.23 EXECSEGS pairing) — the same cont.34 A↔B path — not on the sprite filter.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (gated REX_DRAWCAP `[menudraw]`; 175k lines, 0 real crashes).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.70):** RENDER the menu TEXT via the cont.23 EXECSEGS-transform path — pair the text fill's glyph verts
(pos.local + uv; capture the UVs) with the exec-time reg-0x4000 transform AND the decoded font atlas (cont.68) →
textured readable glyphs at their placement (headless PPM, reusing cont.23's REX_UITEXT). cont.23's transform pairing
already works (it placed a label, just off-screen); the on-screen labels would show readable menu text. New: `[menudraw]`.

## cont.70 (2026-06-07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — ⭐⭐VARIANT A RENDERS THE TITLE'S TEXT READABLE: textured glyphs from the real glyph verts + the decoded font atlas (cont.23's deferred "readable text" step DONE)

New `REX_TEXTRENDER` (kernel.cpp): the text renderer (lr=0x821F90B0, sub_821F8E60) fills stride-16 glyph quads
(pos.local + uv into the bound font atlas, cont.64). `DecodeByBase` decodes the atlas (cont.68, A337D000 256×256
FMT_8), then each 4-vert glyph quad is rasterized (atlas-uv → the glyph's local box, skip the dark glyph bg) into a
per-label PPM. Guest-side, headless — no EXECSEGS/Vulkan.

**RESULT** (REX_TEXTRENDER + REX_DRAWCAP + REX_SKIPINTRO, headless): the title's text renders **READABLE** — label 0
(63 glyphs) = **"This control is used as a runtime indicator of timeline progress"** (kerned, two lines, white-on-black,
`/tmp/cont70_label0.png`, viewed). This completes cont.23's deferred "readable text" step (cont.23 had the placed
glyph GEOMETRY; the font atlas + UVs were the missing piece, now decoded). The full text path — glyph verts (pos+uv) +
decoded font atlas → readable textured text — is proven end-to-end.

⚠ the captured label is an internal DEBUG/tooltip string (the off-screen "63-glyph label" cont.23 found, World.y=866);
all 40 captured frames are this one active label (redrawn). The menu's OWN option labels (PLAY/OPTIONS/level names)
weren't captured — they're transient (REX_SKIPINTRO drives past the menu to Level 1, same as the cont.69 portraits).
Placement is LOCAL (the game's World+Proj transform is exec-time, cont.23); the text CONTENT is readable.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (gated REX_TEXTRENDER; 173k lines, 0 real crashes).

**⇒ the rendering PRIMITIVES all work now:** SPLASHES at real positions (cont.65), menu ASSETS decode (cont.68), TEXT
readable (cont.70). The remaining gap to the live interactive menu = reaching the menu's own draws cleanly (transient
under SKIPINTRO) + game-accurate placement (the exec-time transform, cont.23/34 A↔B).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.71):** reach the menu's OWN text/portrait labels (better input timing — pause at the menu instead of
driving to Level 1) so the real menu options render; OR apply the cont.23 exec-time transform for game-accurate text
placement. New: `REX_TEXTRENDER`, `DecodeByBase`, `[textrender]`.

## cont.71 (2026-06-07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — ⭐⭐the title's REAL MENU/UI TEXT renders readable: dedup unlocks the distinct labels (SELECT GAME MODE, the game description, LOADING…)

cont.70 rendered text but captured only ONE label (the debug string, redrawn 40×). cont.71 adds DEDUP to
REX_TEXTRENDER (by glyph count + first-glyph uv) so each DISTINCT label dumps once. With REX_SKIPINTRO (reaches the
menu/level path): **24 distinct labels — the title's REAL MENU/UI TEXT, readable:**
- **"SELECT GAME MODE"** (a menu screen title)
- **"South Park is under attack! Help Stan, Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny save the town from being destroyed."** (the
  game's intro description — perfectly legible, atlas ACE54000)
- **"LOADING…"**, **"Again!"**, "SELECT", "NEXT"
Montage `/tmp/cont71_menulabels.png` (= `/tmp/SP_cont71_menu_text.png`, viewed). Attract (no SKIPINTRO) renders only 2
labels (the menu text needs the SKIPINTRO path).
⚠ some labels from the **A2D76000** atlas render GARBLED — A2D76000 is a pre-rendered text-STRING atlas (cont.68), not
a glyph grid, so the glyph-quad sampling misaligns; the glyph-atlas labels (A337D000, ACE54000) render clean. A refinement.

**⇒ the title's real menu text RENDERS READABLE.** Combined: SPLASHES at real positions (cont.65), menu ASSETS decode
(cont.68), TEXT readable incl. real menu/UI strings (cont.70–71). The rendering is comprehensive; the live composited
interactive menu (text + portraits at game-accurate positions in ONE frame) still needs the exec-time transform +
clean scene-reaching (cont.34 A↔B), but the CONTENT all renders.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (gated REX_TEXTRENDER; 173k lines, 0 real crashes).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.72):** (a) handle the A2D76000-style pre-rendered-string atlases (render the whole string texture, not
glyph-quad sampling); (b) OR game-accurate placement via the cont.23 exec-time transform; (c) OR consolidate a morning
report (the night's results: splash renders + asset inventory + readable menu text). New: dedup in REX_TEXTRENDER.

## cont.72 (2026-06-07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — consolidation: combined night-results montage + morning report

The night's rendering wins (cont.63–71) are comprehensive. Built `/tmp/SP_night_results.png` (a combined montage: boot
splashes at real positions + the decoded asset inventory + readable menu text) and
`varianta/MORNING-REPORT-2026-06-07.md` (structured summary). NOT sent to the user (asleep until 10:00 MSK) — to
surface at wake. No code change.

**⇒ NEXT (cont.73):** the deep remaining work toward the live composited menu — game-accurate placement via the
cont.23 exec-time transform (pair the captured readable menu labels with reg-0x4000 at EXECSEGS → place them at game
positions; the cont.34 A↔B path), or refine the pre-rendered-string atlases (A2D76000).

## cont.73 (2026-06-07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous — user asleep) — game-accurate placement attempt DEFINITIVELY demonstrates the A↔B wall: the executed segment is a placeholder (only the off-screen debug label), so the real menu text's transform is unavailable

Attempted game-accurate text placement: capture the exec-time World+Proj transform per glyph-count at the prim-13
EXECSEGS draw (cont.23), then apply it in the guest REX_TEXTRENDER raster to place each label at its real screen
position (g_textFrame, `[placed]` diagnostic).

**RESULT** (REX_RENDER+EXECSEGS+UITEXT+TEXTRENDER+SKIPINTRO): DECISIVE — all 16 placed frames are the SAME 63-glyph
DEBUG label (the cont.70 "This control is used as a runtime indicator…" tooltip), ALL **onscreen=0**. Its transform
T=(334,866) P=(0.0016,-0.0028) → clip_y ≈ −1.5 (above the screen) = cont.23's off-screen "World.y=866". The EXECSEGS
prim-13 draws captured ONLY this placeholder label's transform — the real menu text (cont.71: SELECT GAME MODE etc.)
was NOT among them.

**⇒ DEFINITIVE A↔B WALL DEMONSTRATION:** the guest thread builds the REAL menu text (cont.71, readable), but variant A
executes a PLACEHOLDER segment (cont.59) whose only text draw is the off-screen debug label. So the menu text's
TRANSFORM (needed for game-accurate placement) is in the un-executed REAL frame, not the executed placeholder. The menu
CONTENT renders (cont.65/68/70/71); its game-accurate PLACEMENT is the cont.34/59 A↔B wall. This **closes the
menu-rendering investigation**: rendering ✓, placement = A↔B (multi-week).

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (gated; 169k lines, 0 real crashes).

**⇒ CONCLUSION of the night's renderer work:** the rendering PRIMITIVES + CONTENT all work (splashes at real positions
cont.65, decoded assets cont.68, readable menu text cont.70–71); the LIVE composited interactive menu at game-accurate
positions is the cont.34 A↔B wall (the title gates its real frame on GPU completion variant A can't produce; the
executed segment is a placeholder), genuinely multi-week. **⇒ NEXT (cont.74+):** the deep menu work has reached its
wall — shift to refinement/consolidation (slower cadence), or the multi-week A↔B build (execute the real frame). New:
`g_textXform`, `[placed]`.

## cont.74 (2026-06-07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous, refinement) — fix the garbled menu-text labels: the font/glyph atlas is DYNAMIC; decode it fresh per label → the real menu BUTTONS render readable

cont.71's garbled A2D76000 labels root-caused: the 256² font/glyph atlases are **DYNAMIC** — the title refills each
per-label with exactly the glyphs that label needs (decoded A2D76000 = a grid of specific chars: _ © & ( P ) 2 0 9 M
C R O S F T C A N . A L R …). `DecodeByBase` (cont.70) CACHED the decode, so later labels sampled stale glyphs. **FIX:**
DecodeByBase always re-decodes (overwrites the cache slot) so the live atlas content matches each label's uvs.

**RESULT** (REX_TEXTRENDER+DRAWCAP+SKIPINTRO, headless): the real menu BUTTONS/options now render **READABLE** —
**START GAME, LOBBY, OPTIONS, JOIN, BACK, NEXT, DIFFICULTY, AUDIO BRIEFING, START** (+ the game description, LOADING).
30 distinct labels; montage `/tmp/cont74_labels.png`. (A few grid-like labels stay garbled = the title rendering the
glyph-atlas SHEET itself, a separate case.) Refreshed the deliverable `/tmp/SP_night_results.png` with the improved text.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (DecodeByBase only called from gated REX_TEXTRENDER; 164k lines, 0 real crashes).

**⇒ NEXT (cont.75+):** the menu text now renders the real navigation options readable; the live composited menu remains
the cont.34 A↔B wall (cont.73). Continue light refinement / consolidation at a slow cadence. New: DecodeByBase fresh re-decode.

## cont.75 (2026-06-07, /loop "go deep renderer job", autonomous, refinement) — decode the Microsoft Game Studios splash (0xA2FF9000) → the COMPLETE real boot sequence

The platform splash (Microsoft Game Studios, 1280×720 8888) opens the real boot sequence but is shown via a path that
never binds it through SetTexture (so the texdump/compose paths missed it). New `REX_MSSPLASH` decodes 0xA2FF9000
directly (the stable intro-logo working buffer, cont.38/44) → `/tmp/ms_splash_e0.ppm` = the Microsoft Game Studios logo
on its blue gradient, clean (endian 0, nz=256/256 at swap 1). **The complete real boot sequence now renders: Microsoft
Game Studios → SP DIGITAL STUDIOS → Comedy Central → doublesix.** Refreshed the deliverable `/tmp/SP_night_results.png`.
Default boot UNREGRESSED (gated REX_MSSPLASH; 130k lines, 0 real crashes). New: `REX_MSSPLASH`, `[mssplash]`.

## cont.76 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — MONUMENTAL build step 1: prod-oracle MAPS the per-frame GPU-submit architecture (init chain + render thread); variant A RUNS the whole chain — so the A↔B wall is NOT "submit absent" but two MEASURED divergences: the kick-gate device+0x2b04 grows unbounded, and the producer/consumer draw-queue never fires

First step of the A2B-MONUMENTAL-PROMPT (§6.1: prod-oracle the real per-frame command buffer + how the CP consumes it; §6.2: map prod→variant A, find the divergence). MEASUREMENT ONLY — no runtime change (binary unchanged from cont.75 2026-06-07_03:01; `ninja` = "no work to do"; default boot trivially UNREGRESSED). New tools: `varianta/tools/{prod_submit.gdb, va_submit.gdb}`.

**1. prod-oracle: the real per-frame GPU-submit architecture (gdb on the WORKING build, symbolized bt).** ⚠prod traps GPU-register MMIO via mprotect+SIGSEGV (GraphicsSystem::ReadRegister) — gdb halts on the first access unless you `handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint pass`; with that, prod runs to steady-state attract. Two distinct submit chains MEASURED:
- **Init (Main XThread):** `xstart → sub_82249638 → sub_82249678 → sub_8214FFD0 → sub_8212DBA0 → sub_821C7F08` (the per-frame GPU submit) → calls BOTH the completion-setup `sub_821C73D8` (writes the per-submission completion object at device+10900, **ONCE** — `comp` never reached 60, so it is init-only not per-frame) AND the initial ring-kick `sub_821C6600 ← sub_821C6C80 ← sub_821C6D58`.
- **Steady-state per-frame (a DEDICATED render XThread, entry `sub_82450FD0`):** `sub_82450FD0 → sub_821CC5D0 (per-frame submit loop) → sub_821CC310 (the CONSUMER) → sub_821CBDC8 → sub_821C6600 (ring-kick)`. prod kicked **6900× in 40 s** (≈ cont.13's "7062×/45s"). This is the real per-frame command submission — driven by the render thread's consumer.

**2. variant A runs the ENTIRE chain (corrects the prior framing).** `va_submit.gdb` broke every node on a stable-base boot: ALL hit — `sub_8214FFD0`, `sub_8212DBA0`, `sub_821C7F08`, `sub_821C73D8` (completion-setup), `sub_82450FD0` (render thread), `sub_821CC5D0` (submit loop), `sub_821C6600` (kick). ⇒ the per-frame submit + the completion-object registration DO run in variant A (CORRECTS kernel.cpp:1361 / the prompt's "the per-frame submit never runs / executes only device+13568 placeholder"). The chains match prod 1:1. So the wall is NOT an absent submit; it is two specific divergences DOWNSTREAM, both measured below.

**3. Divergence B (completion): the kick-gate device+0x2b04 grows UNBOUNDED.** `sub_821C6C80` kicks the ring only when `*(device+0x2b04)==0`; non-zero ⇒ DEFER (cont.13). REX_KICKGATE on stable-base attract: kicks #0–5 fire at gate=0, then the gate goes `1` and the title keeps incrementing it per submission. REX_CPCOMPLETE (stable base) models completion by decrementing it 1-per-call, but the title increments FASTER → the counter climbs monotonically **1→8→15→22→30→…→671+** and never returns to 0 ⇒ after the first **6** real kicks the gate is ~always closed (first 80 gate-evals: 14 KICK / 66 defer) ⇒ variant A kicks ~120× vs prod's 6900× in 40 s. The pending-submission counter is the GPU-completion debt the title never sees paid (no real GPU completion drains it). This is the B half of A↔B, quantified.

**4. Divergence A (renderer): the producer/consumer draw-queue NEVER fires.** REX_ENQLOG on the same run: `[enq]`=0 and `[consumer]`=0 — the PRODUCER `sub_821CC7A0` (enqueues render work-items) and the CONSUMER `sub_821CC310` (dequeues + calls `*(item+16)` to issue the real draws) are NEVER called at attract. The producer is the gfx-interrupt source=1 (command-buffer-complete) callback at `*(B+0x10)`, `B=*(device+10900)`; in variant A that slot is null/unregistered (REX_BOOTSTRAP, not in the stable base, exists to register it — cont.14). So: `sub_821CC5D0` (the render-thread loop) RUNS but its consumer `sub_821CC310` is never entered (no signalled work) ⇒ no real GPU draws issued. NB: the title still BUILDS all content guest-side (textures/geometry/text — what cont.65–75 captured via the SetTexture / VB-fill / text-renderer hooks); it just never GPU-SUBMITS it through this queue.

**⇒ The A↔B cycle, now fully concrete + measured (both halves):** no real GPU completion → (B) device+0x2b04 not drained → kicks deferred AND (A) producer-callback `*(B+0x10)` never fires → consumer never issues real draws → no real GPU work → no real completion. cont.15 already proved force-opening the kick-gate alone yields only init=0x30088 rects + a crash (the textured draws are producer/consumer work-items, NOT kicked segments) — so the lever is the producer/consumer queue, not the gate. This re-grounds + sharpens cont.12–15 with fresh prod-oracle data and the full thread/chain map (the render thread `sub_82450FD0 → sub_821CC5D0 → sub_821CC310` was not previously mapped end-to-end).

**⭐NEXT (cont.77):** prod-oracle the PRODUCER/CONSUMER work-items — gdb on prod, break `sub_821CC7A0` (producer) + `sub_821CC310` (consumer): capture, per frame, (a) how the producer is invoked (confirm it IS the gfx-interrupt completion callback `*(B+0x10)`, and what fires that interrupt in prod), (b) the work-item vtables/handlers `*(item+16)` the consumer calls to issue the real draws, (c) what those handlers read (the real per-draw geometry + reg-0x4000 transform + reg-0x4800 textures). Then in variant A: confirm whether REX_BOOTSTRAP (register the producer) + a real (not 1-per-call) device+0x2b04 drain makes the consumer fire — and whether its work-items then carry real draws. That maps the exact path to drive A (real draws) + B (real completion) together. Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

## cont.77 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — MONUMENTAL build step 2: prod-oracle EXPOSES the real host GPU command-processor + the producer TRIGGER: the title embeds a PM4 INTERRUPT (0x54) packet in its per-frame IB; prod's CP fires it after the buffer's draws → guest gfx-interrupt sub_821C7170 → producer sub_821CC7A0. variant A ALREADY wires PM4_INTERRUPT→FireGfxInterrupt(1)→sub_821C7170 ⇒ B (kick-gate) GATES A (producer): the IB carrying the INTERRUPT never reaches ExecutePM4 because the kick-gate throttles it

§6.1/§6.2 continued: prod-oracle the producer/consumer work-queue (the real-draw issuer, cont.76). MEASUREMENT ONLY — no runtime change (binary=cont.75; default boot trivially UNREGRESSED). New tool: `varianta/tools/prod_pc.gdb` (breaks the producer `sub_821CC7A0` @0x6f2f20 + consumer `sub_821CC310` @0x6f1ef0 at raw entry, reads guest r3 via `*(uint32_t*)$rdi` since PPCContext r3 is @offset 0, bt). prod runs to attract with `handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint pass` (MMIO trap).

**1. ⭐THE PRODUCER TRIGGER (prod bt, symbolized) — the real host GPU command-processor:** the producer `sub_821CC7A0` is invoked from
```
sub_821CC7A0 (PRODUCER)
 ← sub_821C7170 (guest gfx-interrupt handler, source=1 command-buffer-complete)
 ← rex::runtime::FunctionDispatcher::ExecuteInterrupt
 ← rex::graphics::GraphicsSystem::DispatchInterruptCallback
 ← rex::graphics::CommandProcessor::ExecutePacketType3_INTERRUPT   ← a PM4 INTERRUPT (0x54) packet
 ← ExecutePacketType3 ← ExecutePacket ← ExecuteIndirectBuffer       ← INSIDE the per-frame IB
 ← ExecutePacketType3 ← ExecutePacket ← ExecutePrimaryBuffer        ← the ring
 ← rex::graphics::CommandProcessor::WorkerThreadMain                ← prod's real CP worker thread
```
⇒ prod has a REAL host-side `rex::graphics::CommandProcessor` (WorkerThreadMain reads the ring → ExecutePrimaryBuffer → ExecutePacket → ExecutePacketType3 → ExecuteIndirectBuffer follows the per-frame IB → on the **INTERRUPT (0x54) packet** ExecutePacketType3_INTERRUPT → DispatchInterruptCallback → guest gfx-interrupt `sub_821C7170` → producer). **The producer's trigger IS a PM4 INTERRUPT packet the title embeds in its per-frame indirect buffer** — that packet is the GPU-completion signal, fired AFTER the buffer's draws execute. The producer then enqueues the next render work-item; the consumer issues it next frame. This is the engine of the A↔B loop.

**2. The CONSUMER (prod bt):** `sub_821CC310 ← sub_821CC5D0 ← sub_82450FD0 (render XThread) ← XThread::Execute` — matches cont.76. Runs ~per-frame on the dedicated render thread, dequeues the producer's items.

**3. Work-items (prod, raw-entry r3 reads):** producer r3(item)=**0xDDD10180 / 0xDDD98A80** (the 0xDDxxxxxx GPU/physical command-buffer window), self-relative vtable `*(item)`=0xDDD102A4 (item+0x124); consumer r3(queue)=**0x40019C98** (fixed heap dispatcher), item=`*(r3)`=0x40019A44. `*(item+16)`=0 in BOTH at idle attract ⇒ +16 is NOT the draw handler at this moment (refine the handler offset/indirection in cont.78; cont.54's `*(item+16)` note may be a different item shape or a non-idle frame).

**4. ⭐variant A ALREADY wires this — so B GATES A.** kernel.cpp:1578-1583: ExecutePM4 on `PM4_INTERRUPT` (0x54) does `for n in cpuMask: FireGfxInterrupt(g_interruptCallback, source=1, n)` → CallGuest(`sub_821C7170`) → (in prod) the producer. The wiring EXISTS. So the producer doesn't fire in variant A (cont.76 enq=0) because **the per-frame IB that carries the INTERRUPT packet never reaches variant A's ExecutePM4** — the kick-gate `device+0x2b04` (cont.76 B) is non-zero almost always → `sub_821C6C80` DEFERS the kick → the real per-frame IB is not submitted to the ring → the CP/pump never walks it → never hits the INTERRUPT → never fires the producer. **B (no completion → gate stuck) DIRECTLY GATES A (no producer → no draws).** (Also: FireGfxInterrupt skips source=1 when device+10900==0xFFFFFFFF sentinel, line 1371 — a second possible block.) cont.15 already proved force-opening ONLY the gate = init=0x30088 rects + crash; the proper lever is DRAINING device+0x2b04 via real completion so the title kicks the real per-frame IBs itself. Extensive prior machinery exists for this: REX_BOOTSTRAP (register producer at `*(B+0x10)`), REX_PUMPCB / REX_INVOKECB (cont.17-20, drive producer from the pump via the callback record tagged `0x0001057C`,fn=`0x821CC7A0`,ctx), REX_CPCOMPLETE (the 1-per-call drain, insufficient).

**⇒ Unifies cont.76's two divergences into ONE causal chain:** no real GPU completion → device+0x2b04 not drained → kick deferred → the per-frame IB (real draws + INTERRUPT) never reaches the CP → producer never fires → consumer issues no draws → no real GPU work → no completion. The keystone is the **device+0x2b04 drain** (make the title kick the real per-frame IBs), then variant A's existing PM4_INTERRUPT→producer wiring should light up.

**⭐NEXT (cont.78):** MEASURE whether variant A's ExecutePM4 EVER processes a per-frame IB with real `DRAW_INDX` + a `PM4_INTERRUPT` at attract (REX_CPTRACE → `[cp] IB …` / `[int] PM4_INTERRUPT …` / `[cp] T3 op=0x22`). Two outcomes: (a) the INTERRUPT IB never appears ⇒ confirms the kick-gate blocks it ⇒ attack the device+0x2b04 drain (track real consumed-submission count vs the 1-per-call stub) so the title kicks the real IBs; (b) the INTERRUPT IS processed but FireGfxInterrupt is skipped (sentinel) or sub_821C7170 no-ops ⇒ fix that path. Then (cont.79) make the producer fire → consumer issue draws → ExecutePM4 translate them to vkCmdDraw. Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

## cont.78 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — MONUMENTAL build step 3: variant A's CP processes ONLY the init ring then FREEZES (wptr stuck at 61, 0 XE_SWAP) — the per-frame IBs never reach ExecutePM4 (confirms the kick-gate, cont.77); AND the producer callback *(B+0x10) is NULL even though the source=1 interrupts FIRE — so TWO independent gaps, both measured

§6.2 continued: MEASURE whether variant A's ExecutePM4 ever processes a per-frame IB with DRAW_INDX + INTERRUPT (cont.77's decision point). MEASUREMENT ONLY — no runtime change (binary=cont.75; default boot trivially UNREGRESSED). Two complementary runs, stable-base attract, headless.

**1. REX_CPTRACE — the ring FREEZES after init (the per-frame IBs never reach the CP).** Filtered to structural markers over 18 s: **only 6 `ExecuteRing` calls**, rptr advancing 0→25→31→37→43→49→**61, then the ring write-pointer freezes at wptr=61** (ringDwords=1024) for the rest of the run. 17 IB headers — ALL init/setup buffers (phys 0xA0090040 / 0xA00900E0 / 0xA0120280 / 0xA01A0320 / 0xA01A8780 / 0xA02014000 / 0xA02015980 / 0xA00975A0…, len 11–266 dw). **0 XE_SWAP** (the present packet never reaches the CP). Only 3 PM4_INTERRUPT, all during init. ⇒ DECISIVELY confirms cont.77's outcome (a): the kick-gate `device+0x2b04` freezes the ring after the init submissions → the per-frame IBs (real menu draws + the per-frame INTERRUPT + swap) are NEVER kicked → ExecutePM4 never sees them. This is exactly why the producer (which the per-frame INTERRUPT would fire) never runs at attract.

**2. REX_INTLOG — the source=1 interrupts FIRE, but the producer callback *(B+0x10) is NULL.** 8 source=1 (command-buffer-complete) interrupts in the init window, ALL `-> FIRE` (0 SKIP): `iData=device=0x00026F80`, **B=*(device+10900)=0xA2011000** (a valid completion object in the 0xA2 working-buffer window — NOT the 0xFFFFFFFF sentinel, so line 1371 does NOT skip them), `B[0]=0`, **`*(B+0x10)=0x00000000` (producer callback NULL)**, `*(B+0x14)=0` (producer ctx NULL). ⇒ `sub_821C7170` (the gfx-interrupt handler) RUNS and derefs the valid completion object B, but the producer-callback slot `*(B+0x10)` is unregistered (0) → it has no producer to call → the producer never fires EVEN at the init interrupts. This is the cont.14 gap, now MEASURED live: B is valid + the interrupt fires, but `*(B+0x10)` is the missing registration (in prod the title sets it to 0x821CC7A0; in variant A it stays 0). REX_BOOTSTRAP (kernel.cpp:1366-1369) exists to force `*(B+0x10)=0x821CC7A0`.

**⇒ TWO independent gaps, both measured (refines cont.77):**
- **gap-1 (producer registration):** `*(B+0x10)` (B=device+10900=0xA2011000) is NULL ⇒ even the 8 firing init interrupts can't reach the producer. Fix = register it (REX_BOOTSTRAP).
- **gap-2 (kick-gate / per-frame IBs):** the ring freezes at wptr=61 after init ⇒ the per-frame IBs (with the menu draws + the per-frame INTERRUPT + swap) never reach the CP. Fix = drain `device+0x2b04` so the title kicks the real per-frame IBs (cont.77 keystone).
Both must be closed to build A (real draws) + B (real completion) together: gap-1 lets the INTERRUPT reach the producer; gap-2 makes the per-frame INTERRUPTs (and draws) actually arrive at the CP.

**⭐NEXT (cont.79) — FIRST CHANGE (after 3 measurement iters):** enable REX_BOOTSTRAP (+ likely REX_PUMPCB/REX_INVOKECB, cont.17-20) to register the producer at `*(B+0x10)` and drive it from the 8 firing init interrupts → MEASURE: does the producer (sub_821CC7A0) then fire (REX_ENQLOG `[enq]`>0)? does the consumer (sub_821CC310) then run + issue draws (`[consumer]`>0)? does that produce real GPU work that drains `device+0x2b04` → unfreeze the kick → the title kicks the per-frame IBs (REX_CPTRACE: ExecuteRing advances past 61, XE_SWAP appears)? If the producer fires but the ring stays frozen, gap-2 (the drain) is the separate blocker → attack the `device+0x2b04` real-completion drain next. ⚠keep every change REX_*-gated; default boot must stay unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

## cont.79 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — RE-GROUNDING on cont.13–22 (the authoritative model my cont.76–78 partly rediscovered) + NEW measurement: the GPU-submission FREEZE (wptr=61) is INVARIANT to title-logic advancement — REX_SKIPINTRO→menu→Level-1 freezes IDENTICALLY to attract. The producer/consumer is a CLOSED DEAD-END (bookkeeping, not draws); the wall is the structural A↔B completion coupling

Read the cont.13–22 history before committing to cont.78's planned "enable REX_BOOTSTRAP" change — and FOUND it was already done exhaustively. MEASUREMENT ONLY (binary=cont.75; default boot trivially UNREGRESSED).

**1. RE-GROUNDING — cont.78's "gap-1: register the producer (REX_BOOTSTRAP)" is SUPERSEDED by cont.13–22.** My cont.76–78 prod-oracle re-confirmed the kick-gate + the producer-callback-null + the per-frame-INTERRUPT-trigger with fresh data (valuable: independent re-confirmation + the full render-thread/chain map sub_82450FD0→sub_821CC5D0→sub_821CC310 end-to-end). BUT cont.21–22 already established the AUTHORITATIVE model, which corrects the framing:
- **The producer/consumer (sub_821CC7A0 / sub_821CC310) is PER-SUBMISSION GPU-COMPLETION BOOKKEEPING, NOT the draw path.** cont.21 prod-oracle: the producer fires ~1/frame (not ~800/frame = per-draw), and **`*(item+16)=0` is NORMAL — null in PROD too** (the work-item is a small completion-notification object, not a draw command). So cont.78's `*(item+16)=0` finding = the prod-normal state, NOT a variant-A gap.
- **Driving the producer/consumer is a CLOSED DEAD-END (cont.15–20).** REX_BOOTSTRAP / REX_INVOKECB / REX_PUMPCB were all built + tested: the producer FIRED 6886× with real ctx, the consumer drained the batch (14 items) — yet **0 textured draws (only init=0x30088 rects) + crash**. ⇒ enabling REX_BOOTSTRAP for cont.79 would REPEAT a known-negative experiment. Did NOT.
- **The real draws are PM4 `DRAW_INDX` in kicked IBs**, executed by the host CP → Vulkan (prod: a 3592-dw IB @ phys 0x1dc90540 = guest 0xBDC90540, executed 3×/frame). variant A never reaches them (only kicks the init ring).
- **"Ring flow ≠ content" (cont.22):** across ALL kick rates — 16 (natural) and 2725 (forced-to-0, cont.15) — the title builds ONLY init=0x30088 degenerate rects. More ring flow does NOT produce content. The pending-counter `device+0x2b04` drain is a downstream lever, NOT the content gate; and prod keeps it bounded 0↔1 (per-submission), vs variant A's 1/vblank runaway (drain-RATE mismatch).

**2. ⭐NEW MEASUREMENT — the freeze is INVARIANT to title-logic advancement.** cont.78 measured the ring frozen at wptr=61 at ATTRACT. cont.79 re-ran REX_CPTRACE with **REX_SKIPINTRO=1** (which drives intro→menu→Level-1, where the title renders gameplay) on the CURRENT binary: **IDENTICAL freeze** — 5 ExecuteRing (rptr 0→25→37→43→49→**61, frozen**), 17 IB headers ALL init/setup (max len 266 dw, phys 0xA00xxxxx/0xA011xxxx/0xA2014xxx), **0 XE_SWAP**, 3 PM4_INTERRUPT, NO large content IB (prod's is 3592 dw). ⇒ the GPU-submission freeze is the SAME whether the title is at attract or has advanced its logic to Level 1. The title's frontend/gameplay-logic progress (cont.30–34 loads L1) does NOT change the GPU submission — it never kicks the content draw IBs regardless. **The content-draw submission is gated PURELY on the A↔B completion coupling, independent of how far the title's logic advances.** (Resolves cont.22's open question — reaching L1 does NOT unblock content.)

**⇒ The A↔B wall is the structural GPU-CP/completion COUPLING, reconfirmed in the advanced state.** No measured shortcut exists: forcing the gate (cont.15/22) → init rects only; driving the producer/consumer (cont.15–21) → init rects + crash; advancing title-logic to L1 (cont.79) → identical freeze. The two pillars must be built TOGETHER (cont.21): **(A)** per-submission completion so the title keeps kicking its draw IBs, and **(B)** DRAW_INDX→Vulkan translation (the draw-state side partially exists: cont.22 T2b backdrop, cont.58-65 g_texPipe / SubmitTexturedGeometry / EXECSEGS draw path). The coupling: can't flow the ring (A) without rendering (B); can't render (B) without the ring flowing (A).

**⭐NEXT (cont.80) — FIRST CODE CHANGE, faithful pillar A:** replace REX_CPCOMPLETE's 1/vblank drain with a PER-SUBMISSION `device+0x2b04` decrement (cont.22's correction — decrement once per submission the CP actually completes, e.g. hooked to each EVENT_WRITE_SHD / per-submission fence the ring carries, bounding the counter ≤1 like prod's 0↔1) behind a new gated flag. MEASURE: does the counter stay bounded ≤1? does the kick rate reach prod-like ~55%? does ANY larger IB appear past wptr=61? Expectation per cont.22 = bounded counter but still init-only (the drain is non-content-gating) — if confirmed in the advanced state, that DEFINITIVELY isolates the remaining work to the A↔B coupling itself (executed-submission → real completion side-effects the title's handshake sees), and pillar B becomes the focus. ⚠gated; default boot must stay unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

## cont.80 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — the COMPLETION CONTRACT measured: the title CONTINUOUSLY BUILDS a per-frame command buffer every frame (build cursor device+13568 marches ~0x88880/frame through 0xA00xxxxx) and gates each frame on the fence at 0xA2010000 (sub_821C6E58); variant A blindly FORWARDS the fence → the title keeps building but its per-frame buffers are NEVER executed. These unkicked build-cursor buffers are the candidate "real per-frame command stream"; the fence-wait is the live per-frame sync point

Instead of repeating a drain variant (cont.22 = non-content-gating), measured the FENCE/completion contract (the untested lever — cont.21: the blind fence-forward SUPPRESSES submission). MEASUREMENT ONLY (binary=cont.75; default boot trivially UNREGRESSED). Used the existing default-on `[fencewait]`/`[fencefwd]` diags (kernel.cpp:3464/3481).

**The completion contract (sub_821C6E58, stable-base attract):**
- The fence lives at **0xA2010000** (`fenceptr = *(device+10896)`). The title polls `*(fenceptr)` (=`current`) and waits for it to reach `target` (r4). `head` (`*(device+10908)`) is the title's own build-ahead position.
- **`head` advances +6 EVERY frame** (17→23→29→35→41→47→53→59→65→71→77→83…); `target` tracks +6/frame (7→15→21→27→33→39→45→51→57→63→69→75). So the title is building ~1 submission (6 fence-units) per frame, continuously.
- **⭐The build cursor `device+13568` MARCHES FORWARD every frame** — `build=GLD32(device+13568)`: 0xA0090180 → 0xA0117B00 → 0xA01A0380 → 0xA0228C00 → 0xA02B1480 → 0xA0339D00 → … (~**0x88880/frame**, walking up through the **0xA00xxxxx physical window — the SAME window as the kicked init IBs measured cont.78** at 0xA0090040/0xA00900E0/0xA0120280). ⇒ the title allocates + fills a NEW per-frame command buffer each frame.
- **variant A blindly FORWARDS the fence:** 25 `[fencefwd]` in 15s (`fence@0xA2010000 5→7, 23→27, 27→33, 33→39…`) — it fakes `current→target` so sub_821C6E58 returns, letting the title proceed to build the NEXT frame. But the per-frame buffer is NEVER executed (the ring froze at wptr=61, cont.78; these buffers aren't kicked).

**⇒ The title IS continuously producing real per-frame command buffers (the build cursor proves it) — variant A just never executes them.** These **unkicked build-cursor buffers (0xA0117B00, 0xA01A0380, …) are the candidate "real per-frame command stream"** the prompt §3.1 asks for (NOT the frozen kicked ring, NOT the recycled EXECSEGS snapshot). The fence-wait `sub_821C6E58` is the precise per-frame SYNC POINT — at that moment `device+13568` points at the current frame's buffer with (potentially) LIVE geometry, before the title recycles it. The code's own comment (kernel.cpp:3461-3462) already names the faithful fix: *"design a real CP that advances the counter by executing the built EVENT_WRITE_SHD fence-writes instead of forwarding."*

**⚠CAVEAT (must resolve before claiming victory):** cont.15 force-opened the kick-gate → 2725 kicks executed → **only init=0x30088 rects, 0 content**. So either (a) the build-cursor buffers are setup/init only (the content draws are elsewhere / not built in this state), or (b) cont.15 executed them at the WRONG time (after the title recycled the geometry VBs — cont.59's placeholder verts=0,0). The fence-wait timing (live) is the distinguishing test.

**⭐NEXT (cont.81) — INSPECT the build-cursor buffer at the live sync point:** hook sub_821C6E58; BEFORE forwarding the fence, read `buf=GLD32(device+13568)` and walk it as PM4 (REX_CPTRACE-style, depth-bounded, gated behind a new flag e.g. REX_FRAMEBUF) — dump: does it contain `DRAW_INDX` (0x22/0x36)? what PRIMS (init-rect 0x30088 vs the content prims 5/13 cont.69-73)? is the slot-0/slot-1 geometry LIVE (real verts, vs cont.59 placeholder 0,0)? + any `EVENT_WRITE_SHD`. This decisively resolves the caveat: if the build-cursor buffer carries LIVE content `DRAW_INDX` at the fence-wait, then executing it there (ExecutePM4 → vkCmdDraw) + advancing the fence as the natural result = the real per-frame execution (§6.3). If it's init-only, the content draws are genuinely not built in this state → the wall is upstream (the title won't build content without real completion, cont.21-22). ⚠measurement first (read-only walk), no execution yet; gated; default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

## cont.81 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — ⭐CODE CHANGE (REX_FRAMEBUF): the build-cursor directory AT THE FENCE-WAIT carries the REAL per-frame CONTENT draws — a frame with prim-5 sprites, a prim-13 TEXT label (252 glyph indices), prim-4 content + a LIVE prim-8 backdrop quad. The backdrop geometry (slot-0) is LIVE; the content draws read slot-1 (liveness needs the INDEXED-vert read, my pool[0] check was a false-negative)

First CODE CHANGE of the monumental build (gated, default boot UNREGRESSED — verified: 210k-line headless boot, 0 real crashes, `[framebuf]` absent when the flag is off). Added `REX_FRAMEBUF`: a READ-ONLY walker (`FrameBufDump`, kernel.cpp) hooked in sub_821C6E58 (the per-frame fence-wait SYNC POINT, cont.80) — before forwarding the fence, it walks the build-cursor directory + segments, shadows the fetch region (0x4800) to locate each draw's vertex pool, and reports DRAW_INDX prims + vert liveness. No execution / no side effects.

**1. The build-cursor structure (resolved cont.80's field ambiguity):** at the fence-wait `device+13568`=**0xA0090180** is NOT the directory base — it is the per-submission COMPLETION WORK-ITEM: `GLD32(0xA0090180)=0xC00902A4` = self+0x124 vtable, then 0x80000000, 0 — the SAME layout as cont.77's prod producer item (item=0xDDD10180, vtable@+0x124). The DIRECTORY is the range `[device+13572, device+13568]` = [0xA0015DD8 .. 0xA0090180]; my scan finds **descs=1, segs=1** per frame (one content segment).

**2. ⭐THE SEGMENT AT THE FENCE-WAIT CARRIES THE REAL PER-FRAME CONTENT DRAWS.** Most fence-waits the segment is setup-only (draws=0), but one captured frame had **draws=8**:
```
prim=5  numI=4   slot1 vbase=0xA01FE0FC  v0=(0,0)        dead   (sprite)
prim=4  numI=6   slot1 vbase=0xA018A244  v0=(0,0)        dead   (content)
prim=5  numI=4   slot1 vbase=0xA018A244  v0=(0,0)        dead   (sprite)
prim=13 numI=252 slot1 vbase=0xA01FE0FC  v0=(0,0)        dead   (TEXT — 252 glyph indices = a real label)
prim=8  numI=3   slot0 vbase=0xA01A8730  v0=(-0.5,-0.5)  LIVE   (backdrop corner)
prim=8  numI=3   slot0 vbase=0xA01A8748  v0=(639.5,-0.5) LIVE   (640x360 fullscreen quad)
prim=8  numI=3   slot0 vbase=0xA01A8760  v0=(-0.5,359.5) LIVE
prim=8  numI=3   slot0 vbase=0xA01A8778  v0=(639.5,359.5)LIVE
```
⇒ the build-cursor segment IS the "real per-frame command stream" (§3.1) — it carries the menu CONTENT draws (sprites + a 252-glyph text label + content) AND a backdrop, at the live fence-wait sync point. The **backdrop (slot-0, prim 8) geometry is LIVE** (real screen corners of a 640×360 quad) — variant A could translate THAT to vkCmdDraw right now.

**3. ⚠Content-draw liveness is INCONCLUSIVE (my check was too crude).** The content draws (prim 5/13/4) read slot-1 (vbase 0xA01FE0FC / 0xA018A244) and my walker reported v0=(0,0) "dead" — BUT it read pool[0], while these draws are INDEXED (numI=4/6/252), so the actual verts are at the INDEXED offsets (vbase + idx*stride), not pool[0]. The backdrop (prim 8, auto-indexed from 0) legitimately read pool[0]=live. So the content draws' liveness needs the indexed-vert read (cont.59's [esidx] logic) — pool[0]=(0,0) is a FALSE-NEGATIVE here.

**⇒ MAJOR: this is the first time variant A has REACHED the real per-frame content draws at a point where (at least the backdrop) geometry is LIVE — distinct from the frozen kicked ring (cont.78), and richer than the cont.59 EXECSEGS-at-VdSwap snapshot.** The fence-wait directory segment is the right place + time. Open: are the CONTENT draws' (slot-1) indexed verts live here too (cont.59 found the real menu geometry is in dynamic VBs like 0xA022FFF0, NOT slot-1)?

**⭐NEXT (cont.82):** refine `FrameBufDump` — for prim 5/13/4 draws, read the INDEXED verts (parse the draw's index buffer: op-0x22 data[2]=idxBase, data[3]=size; read indices u16/u32; read verts at vbase+idx*stride, like cont.59 [esidx]) → resolve whether the CONTENT geometry is LIVE at the fence-wait. (a) If LIVE → execute this segment at the fence-wait (ExecutePM4 → vkCmdDraw, reuse the EXECSEGS draw-state path) = the first REAL per-frame composited frame (§6.3); start with the LIVE backdrop, then the content. (b) If DEAD (verts in dynamic VBs 0xA022FFF0 not slot-1) → the content draws' slot-1 binding is placeholder; the real verts are in the text/sprite renderers' dynamic VBs (cont.47/59) → bridge them. Either way the backdrop is executable now. ⚠gated; default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (REX_FRAMEBUF gated; 210k-line boot, 0 crashes).

## cont.82 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — ⭐⭐LIVE per-frame content geometry IS reachable at the fence-wait (at the MENU): the build-cursor segment's draws have densely-populated vertex pools (poolRealF 487–961/1024) — the LIVE backdrop (prim 8, slot-0) AND live content sprites (prim 5, slot-95, marching pool 0xA0Dxxxxx); only the slot-1-bound draws (fixed 0xA01FE0FC) are the cont.59 placeholder (dead)

Refined `FrameBufDump` (REX_FRAMEBUF) to resolve cont.81's content-liveness caveat: read the INDEXED verts (op-0x22 data[2]=idxBase, idxFmt init[11]) at vbase+idx*8, PLUS a robust pool float-DENSITY scan (`poolRealF` = plausible-vertex-floats in the head 1024 dw). Raised the fence-wait sample cap 6→250 (cont.81's 6 only caught INIT/intro frames — empty pools; the menu content frames come later). Default boot UNREGRESSED (gated; 173k-line headless boot, 0 real crashes, `[framebuf]` absent when off).

**⭐THE RESULT — at the menu, the per-frame segment carries LIVE content geometry** (frames with descs=4-8, draws=4-7, contentDraws=3, **liveDraws up to 4**):
- **prim-5 sprites with slot-95 fetch, marching pool `vbase=0xA0D640A0→0xA0DEC8A0→…` (advances per frame), `poolRealF=487–961/1024`, pool[0]=(245.5,76.5)** — a plausible screen coord. **LIVE.** These are real per-frame UI sprite draws with populated vertex pools.
- **prim-8 backdrop, slot-0, marching pool (0xA0342FC8 / 0xA1AB9880 / …), poolRealF 75–961** — consistently **LIVE** (the 640×360 backdrop quad, cont.81).
- prim-5/13 draws bound to **slot-1 fixed `vbase=0xA01FE0FC`, poolRealF=0** — **dead** (the cont.59 placeholder pool; the real verts for those are in the dynamic VBs, cont.47/59).
⇒ each per-frame segment MIXES live draws (backdrop + slot-95 sprites, densely populated) and dead draws (slot-1 content). **But LIVE per-frame content geometry demonstrably EXISTS at the fence-wait at the menu** — distinct from the frozen ring (cont.78) and the cont.59 EXECSEGS-at-VdSwap snapshot (all-placeholder).

**⚠RIGOR / measurement caveats:**
- The liveness verdict rests on **`poolRealF` (density)**, NOT the exact indexed verts: my index parse returns `idx=[0,0,0]` for every draw (the draws are AUTO-indexed — srcSel=2, no index buffer — and my `(ibRaw&0x1FFFFFFF)<0x20000000` guard let the non-index data[2] through, so `iv`=pool[0], often the wrong offset; e.g. the live backdrop reads pool[0]=(0,0) yet poolRealF=961). poolRealF is the reliable signal (finite floats in a screen/authoring range); pool[0]=(245.5,76.5) on the live sprites corroborates.
- poolRealF=high proves the pool is densely populated with plausible vertex floats; cont.83 must confirm (by executing + capturing) that they render as real geometry, not just dense data.

**⇒ MAJOR (the monumental build's first real foothold):** variant A can REACH the title's real per-frame draws WITH LIVE geometry at the fence-wait sync point. The backdrop + slot-95 sprites are executable now. This is the §3.1 "real per-frame command stream" found at a point where its geometry is live — the prerequisite for §6.3 (execute → vkCmdDraw → real composited frame).

**⭐NEXT (cont.83) — EXECUTE the live draws at the fence-wait (§6.3):** hook sub_821C6E58; for the build-cursor segment, translate the LIVE draws' DRAW_INDX → vkCmdDraw (reuse the EXECSEGS draw-state path / `g_texPipe` / `SubmitTexturedGeometry`, cont.58-65) — start with the prim-8 backdrop (definitely live) + the slot-95 prim-5 sprites; SKIP the dead slot-1 draws (poolRealF=0). Capture REX_RENDER_SHOT = the first real per-frame composited frame. Refine the index parse first (detect auto-index srcSel=2 vs indexed, read the real per-vertex stride from the VS vfetch) to carve exact geometry + map each draw's texture (slot-0 d1, cont.57). Then (§6.4) advance the fence as the natural result of executing the segment (vs blind forward). ⚠execution at the fence-wait has side effects (fires EVENT_WRITE_SHD/INTERRUPT) — gate carefully, verify default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (REX_FRAMEBUF gated; 173k-line boot, 0 crashes).

## cont.83 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — exact vertex layout of the LIVE fence-wait draws + a RIGOR CORRECTION: cont.82's "slot-95 live content sprites" were a FALSE-POSITIVE (density heuristic misreading command-buffer dwords). The reliably-LIVE draws are the prim-8 set (slot-0): the BACKDROP (stride-8 screen quads tiling 1280×720) AND textured UI quads (stride-16 pos+uv). The prim-5/13 slot-1 draws stay dead (cont.59 placeholder)

Refined `FrameBufDump` to dump `srcSel` + the raw vbase floats of each LIVE draw, to carve exact geometry (resolving cont.82's idx=[0,0,0] caveat) before rendering. Default boot UNREGRESSED (gated; 111k-line headless boot, 0 real crashes, `[framebuf]` absent when off).

**1. ⚠RIGOR CORRECTION to cont.82 — "slot-95 live content sprites" RETRACTED.** Across cont.83's runs the prim-5/13 content draws are CONSISTENTLY slot-1 `vbase=0xA01FE0FC poolRealF=0 dead`; cont.82's "slot-95, vbase=0xA0D640A0, poolRealF=487–961, LIVE" did NOT reproduce. Re-examining cont.82: that vbase **marches with the build cursor** (0xA0D640A0→0xA0DEC8A0/frame = the command-buffer region) and the SAME vbase gave DIFFERENT poolRealF (487 vs 961) across reads ⇒ slot-95's "pool" pointed INTO the per-frame command buffer, and the `poolRealF` density heuristic misread **PM4 command dwords as plausible floats** (false-positive). ⇒ the slot-95 content-sprite liveness is UNCONFIRMED / spurious. (Lesson: float-density ≠ vertex data; carve+verify the exact verts.)

**2. ✅CONFIRMED (exact layout) — the prim-8 draws (slot-0, src=2 auto-index) are genuinely LIVE.** Dumped vbase floats:
- **BACKDROP, stride-8 (pos.xy):** verts `(-0.5,-0.5) (639.5,-0.5) (639.5,359.5) (1279.5,-0.5) (1279.5,359.5)` / `(-0.5,359.5) (639.5,359.5) (639.5,719.5) (1279.5,359.5) (1279.5,719.5)` — real screen-space triangles tiling the **1280×720** screen (cont.81's corners). Renderable as-is (NDC: x/640−1, 1−y/360).
- **⭐textured UI quads, stride-16 (pos.xy + uv):** e.g. `(458.5,38.5)·uv(0.6,0.2)`, `(443.5,38.5)·uv(0.6,0.3)`, `(54.5,37.5)·uv(0.5,0.3)`, `(441.5,−0.5)·uv(1.0,0.2)`, `(421.5,38.5)·uv(0.9,0.3)` — real screen positions (a top UI strip at y≈0–38) WITH texture coords. So the segment ALSO carries LIVE TEXTURED UI content. 13 distinct prim-8 vertex-format rows captured.

**3. The prim-5/13 draws (slot-1 `0xA01FE0FC`) remain DEAD** (poolRealF=0) — their real geometry is in the dynamic VBs (cont.47/59 0xA022FFF0), not the segment's slots. Those draws need the dynamic-VB bridge; the prim-8 draws do not.

**⇒ HONEST STATE (rigor-corrected):** at the fence-wait, the **prim-8 draws (slot-0) have CONFIRMED live renderable geometry — the backdrop (stride-8) + textured UI quads (stride-16 pos+uv) — executable now.** cont.82's broader "content sprites live" was over-claimed (density false-positive, retracted). The prim-5/13 slot-1 content remains the cont.59 dynamic-VB wall. Still a real foothold: live, exact, renderable per-frame geometry (backdrop + textured UI) IS reachable at the fence-wait.

**⭐NEXT (cont.84) — RENDER the live prim-8 draws (§6.3):** at the fence-wait, carve the prim-8 draws' verts (auto-index src=2 → sequential `vbase + j*stride`; detect stride 8 vs 16 by whether floats 8–11 are uv-range [0,1] vs screen-range) → NDC → submit to `g_texPipe`/`SubmitTexturedGeometry` (cont.58-65); for stride-16, bind the draw's texture (slot-0 d1 fetch const, cont.57). Start with the backdrop (stride-8, definitely live), then the textured UI strip. Capture REX_RENDER_SHOT = first real per-frame composited frame. ⚠the render submission must reach the render thread (the fence-wait is on the guest thread) — reuse the cont.60/65 bridge; gate behind a new flag; verify default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (REX_FRAMEBUF gated; 111k-line boot, 0 crashes).

## cont.84 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — RENDER attempt (REX_FRAMEDRAW) + SET_CONSTANT2 shadow fix: HONEST NEGATIVE — the fence-wait segment yields a LIVE but UNTEXTURED backdrop and NO resolvable textured content; the content draws are slot-1 DEAD (prim-13 text, cont.59 placeholder) or slot-95 density-FALSE-POSITIVE (prim-5, vbase marches with the command buffer). The cont.59 dynamic-VB wall persists for content; cont.81-82's "live content geometry" is corrected — only the backdrop is reliably live

Implemented the §6.3 render path + a real bug fix; the measured result is a NEGATIVE that rigorously narrows the wall. Default boot UNREGRESSED (gated; 108k-line headless boot, 0 real crashes, `[framebuf]`/`[framedraw]` absent when off).

**Changes (gated):** (1) `REX_FRAMEDRAW` — at the fence-wait, composite each LIVE prim-8 draw into `g_frameBuf` at its REAL screen rect (carved from the verts' screen-range pairs) via the cont.66 `AccumulateFrame` bridge (decode texture + blit), flushed to `/tmp/cont66_frame_NNN.ppm` by `SnapshotFrameOnSwap` (REX_FCOMPOSE). (2) **Bug fix:** added `SET_CONSTANT2` (op 0x55, absolute 16-bit reg index) to the `FrameBufDump` fetch shadow — it was MISSING (the shadow only had SET_CONSTANT 0x2D + type-0), so fetch/texture consts bound via 0x55 (cont.54: the channel that binds the texture consts) were not captured.

**Result — NO composite produced (0 frames), measured cause:**
- **The reliably-LIVE backdrop (prim 8, slot-0) has NO texture** — `texB=0` (no 0x02/0xA2 base in the fetch shadow) even WITH the SET_CONSTANT2 fix. It is an untextured clear/gradient fill (geometry only). So `AccumulateFrame` (which needs a texture) composites nothing for it.
- **The content draws are not resolvable:** prim-13 TEXT draws (numI=100/156 glyphs) are slot-1 `vbase=0xA01FE0FC poolRealF=0 DEAD` (the cont.59 placeholder); prim-5 draws show slot-95 `vbase=0xA0DEC920→0xA0EFDA00→…` (MARCHES with the build cursor) with `poolRealF` varying 367/455/961 for the same draw ⇒ a **density FALSE-POSITIVE** (command-buffer dwords, exactly cont.83's correction). The SET_CONSTANT2 fix did NOT change the content draws' vertex slot (still slot-1 dead / slot-95 spurious).

**⇒ RIGOROUS NARROWING (corrects cont.81-82):** at the fence-wait the segment carries LIVE BACKDROP geometry (real screen quads, untextured) but **NO resolvable textured CONTENT** — the content draws reference the dead slot-1 placeholder pool (cont.59) or a spurious command-buffer region (slot-95). The real content geometry is built by the guest text/sprite renderers into dynamic VBs (cont.47/59 0xA022FFF0 — found EMPTY on textured draws, cont.61), NOT the segment's fetch slots. So **executing the fence-wait segment renders only the (untextured) backdrop; the menu CONTENT geometry remains the cont.59/73 dynamic-VB wall.** cont.81-82's "live content geometry reachable" was over-optimistic (the slot-95 density signal was the command buffer); the honest, reproduced state is: backdrop live+untextured, content unresolvable from the segment.

**⇒ WHAT THE FENCE-WAIT ANGLE DID ESTABLISH (cont.80-84, real progress):** the title's real per-frame command stream IS the build-cursor directory segment at the fence-wait (cont.80-81); it carries the real draw STRUCTURE (prim-8 backdrop + prim-13 text-252/156/100-glyph + prim-5 sprites, the menu's draw list) with a LIVE backdrop; the completion contract (fence 0xA2010000, build cursor device+13568, cont.80) is mapped; SET_CONSTANT2 fetch-binding now shadowed. The remaining wall is unchanged from cont.59/73: the content draws' GEOMETRY (+ per-draw texture) is in the guest renderers' dynamic VBs, not resolvable in the executed segment.

**⭐NEXT (cont.85):** two honest tracks — (a) RENDER THE BACKDROP as the first executed per-frame draw: it's reliably live geometry; recover its fill (the draw's ALU/clear color or its gradient, from the segment's state) and fill `g_frameBuf` at the carved screen quads → a real (if plain) per-frame frame executed from the segment (proves the carve+compose end-to-end). (b) BRIDGE content WHERE↔WHAT: the segment gives screen positions (the backdrop tiling + the text draws' transform); the guest hooks (cont.65-75) give decoded content — match the prim-13 text draw's exec-time transform (cont.23/73) to the decoded text (cont.71) for game-accurate text placement. Track (a) is the cleaner next measurable win. ⚠gated; default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (REX_FRAMEDRAW gated; 108k-line boot, 0 crashes).

## cont.85 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — ⭐RE-OPENS the cont.73 wall: the fence-wait segment carries the REAL menu text labels' exec-time TRANSFORMS (reg 0x4000 screen→NDC proj + World origins), multiple distinct labels (numI=100/156/228/396) — NOT just cont.73's single debug label. So the game-accurate transform path (cont.23/73) IS accessible at the fence-wait

Pursued track (b): shadow the ALU region (reg 0x4000) in `FrameBufDump` and read the prim-13 TEXT draws' exec-time World+Proj transform — does the fence-wait give the REAL menu labels' on-screen positions (vs cont.73's off-screen debug label at VdSwap timing)? Default boot UNREGRESSED (gated; 112k-line headless boot, 0 real crashes, `[fwxform]`/`[framebuf]` absent when off).

**Change (gated, measurement):** extended the `FrameBufDump` shadow to also capture the ALU consts 0x4000..0x407F (the transform) — via SET_CONSTANT type=0, SET_CONSTANT2 to 0x4000, and type-0 writes (the same 3 channels as the fetch shadow). New `[fwxform]` diag: for each prim-13 draw, read `Tx=c0.w Ty=c1.w Px=c4.x Pxw=c4.w Py=c5.y Pyw=c5.w` and project the World origin → clip.

**⭐RESULT — the REAL menu labels' transforms ARE at the fence-wait (re-opens cont.73):** the prim-13 draws carry MULTIPLE distinct real labels with a REAL screen→NDC projection `Proj=(0.0016,−0.0028)+(−1.0,1.0)` (= 2/1280, 2/720 — the screen-ortho), set in reg 0x4000:
```
numI=100  World=(-183.5, 243.7)   clip=(-1.287, 0.323)
numI=156  World=(-183.5, 311.4)   clip=(-1.287, 0.135)
numI=228  World=(-183.5,-116.3)   clip=(-1.287, 1.323)
numI=396  World=(-183.5, 243.7) / (-183.5,-116.3)
numI=252  World=( 333.6, 866.0)   = cont.73's off-bottom DEBUG label (continuity)
```
⇒ the fence-wait segment has the REAL menu labels (numI 100/156/228/396 = distinct label lengths, the menu's text list) WITH their real screen-ortho transforms — a genuine ADVANCE over cont.73 (which, at VdSwap timing, only had the single off-screen debug label and concluded the real labels' transforms were unavailable = the A↔B wall). **The real labels' transforms ARE accessible at the fence-wait sync point.**

**The positions (attract state):** all the real menu labels share origin **World.x=−183.5** (clip_x≈−1.29, off-screen LEFT) at various y — they are LEFT-aligned labels whose origin sits off the left edge and whose text extends RIGHT onto the screen (a 396-glyph label spans ~−183→+800, mostly on-screen). So at the passive attract state the label origins are parked off-left (a left menu column / sliding-in / description text). The "15 ON-SCREEN" hits were spurious (proj=(0,0) — alu unset for those draws → origin→(0,0)).

**⇒ HONEST STATE:** the game-accurate menu-text WHERE is now readable at the fence-wait (real proj + per-label World origin), re-opening cont.73's wall. Combined with the decoded text WHAT (cont.71), this is the path to game-accurate menu text. The label origins are off-left at attract (passive) — reaching a clean menu-shown state (input nav) or compositing the right-extending text would show on-screen text.

**⭐NEXT (cont.86):** PAIR the WHERE (fence-wait prim-13 transform: proj + World origin per label) with the WHAT (cont.71 decoded text / cont.70 glyph raster): for each prim-13 draw, take its World origin + the screen-ortho proj, and render the decoded text label at that game-accurate screen position into g_frameBuf (reuse cont.70-71 REX_TEXTRENDER raster + the cont.66 frame accumulator); capture the PPM. The label geometry (slot-1) is dead (cont.84), but the TRANSFORM (origin) + the decoded glyphs (cont.71) suffice to place the text. ⚠match label-by-label (numI/glyph-count ↔ cont.71's deduped labels); gate; verify default boot. Default boot UNREGRESSED (REX_FRAMEBUF gated; 112k-line boot, 0 crashes).

## cont.86 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — the game-accurate text-placement MECHANISM is WIRED + works (REX_FWPLACE feeds the fence-wait transforms into the existing cont.73 pairing), but the visible on-screen menu is blocked by TWO measured gaps: the text-render captures only the debug label's glyphs, AND all the fence-wait transforms are OFF-SCREEN (the title parks the menu labels off-screen at the attract/transition states it reaches = the cont.34 progression wall)

Wired the cont.85 transforms into the cont.73 placement pairing. Default boot UNREGRESSED (gated; 110k-line headless boot, 0 real crashes).

**Change (gated `REX_FWPLACE`):** in `FrameBufDump`, for each prim-13 draw with a REAL transform (Px≠0), write `g_textXform[numI] = {Tx,Ty,Px,Pxw,Py,Pyw}` — so the EXISTING `REX_TEXTRENDER` (cont.70-73) places the decoded text at the fence-wait (real) transform instead of the EXECSEGS debug-label transform. Minimal new code — reuses the whole cont.73 pairing (`g_textXform` keyed by glyph-count == the text snapshot's vert count).

**Result — the MECHANISM WORKS, but only the debug label is placed (off-screen):** all 16 `[placed]` = the 63-glyph debug label at its REAL fence-wait transform `T=(334,866)` (off-screen, correctly — that IS where the title puts the debug label). Diagnosis (one run, [fwxform]+[text]+[placed]):
- ✅ The fence-wait FEEDS the real transforms: `g_textXform` got numI=**100/156/228/252/396** (the real menu labels, cont.85).
- ❌ Gap 1 — the text-render SNAPSHOT capture got ONLY the **63-glyph debug label** (16×, vc=252); the real menu labels' GLYPHS were NOT captured this run (a cont.70-71 timing/dedup issue — even with SKIPINTRO the title rushes intro→menu→Level-1 and only the persistent debug label is snapshotted; the transient menu labels cont.71 caught need the right window). So there is no real-label snapshot to pair with the real-label transform.
- ❌ Gap 2 — **EVERY fence-wait transform is OFF-SCREEN** (the real labels at World.x=−183.5 off-left, the debug at y=866 off-bottom; 0 ON-SCREEN). The title PARKS the menu labels off-screen at the attract + skipintro-transition states variant A reaches.

**⇒ HONEST STATE:** the game-accurate text-placement MECHANISM is complete + proven (fence-wait transform → `g_textXform` → `REX_TEXTRENDER` placement; the debug label IS placed at its real transform). But a VISIBLE on-screen menu needs (1) the real labels' glyph snapshots captured at the same moment, and (2) the title to reach the **fully-shown menu state where the labels are on-screen** — which it does NOT at attract/transition (the labels are parked off-left). **Gap 2 is the cont.34 A↔B progression wall resurfacing:** the title doesn't progress to the shown-menu state (it's gated on GPU completion), so its menu labels stay parked off-screen. So the text-placement half is mechanically done; the on-screen result is gated on the title's progression (cont.34).

**⇒ SUMMARY of the fence-wait arc (cont.80-86):** the monumental build MAPPED the title's real per-frame command stream (the build-cursor segment at the fence-wait, cont.80-81), its completion contract (fence 0xA2010000 + build cursor device+13568, cont.80), its real draw STRUCTURE (prim-8 backdrop + prim-13 100/156/228/252/396-glyph text labels + prim-5 sprites, cont.81-85), a LIVE backdrop (cont.82-83), and the REAL menu labels' game-accurate TRANSFORMS (cont.85) — and WIRED them into the text-placement pipeline (cont.86). The remaining walls are unchanged in nature: the content GEOMETRY is in unpopulated dynamic VBs (cont.59), and the title doesn't progress to the shown-menu state (cont.34) — both gated on real GPU completion, the multi-week A↔B coupling.

**⭐NEXT (cont.87):** two tracks — (a) CLOSE gap 1 cheaply: capture the real menu labels' glyph snapshots at the right window (reuse cont.71's dedup capture timing) WHILE the fence-wait transforms are live, and render them at their (off-screen-left) game-accurate positions → a faithful (partly-visible) capture proving the full WHERE+WHAT pipeline end-to-end; (b) attack gap 2 / the cont.34 progression: why the title parks the labels off-left (World.x=−183.5) — is it a menu-slide animation gated on a frame-count/completion the title never sees, or a fixed off-screen attract layout? Track (a) is the cleaner measurable win (proves the pipeline); track (b) is the deep A↔B coupling. ⚠gated; default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (REX_FWPLACE gated; 110k-line boot, 0 crashes).

## cont.87 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — MEASURED CEILING of the text-placement angle: the real labels ARE captured (24 distinct), but the fence-wait segment transforms and the guest glyph-fills are DIFFERENT draw streams whose vert-counts overlap only at the (off-screen) debug label → the cont.73 count-pairing places only it → the captured frame is BLACK. The text-placement angle is capped by the cont.34/stream-mismatch A↔B walls

Closed gap-1's open question by measurement (no code change; binary=cont.86, default boot trivially unregressed). Ran the full pipeline (REX_FWPLACE + REX_TEXTRENDER + the cont.71 dedup capture) and inspected the actual output PNG.

**MEASURED:**
- ✅ The real menu labels ARE captured (gap-1 "capture" was NOT the blocker): `[textrender]` dumped **24 distinct labels** (/tmp/cont71_text_*.ppm) with vert-counts {16×5, 20, 24×2, 32, 36, 40×3, 44, 48, 56, 64×2, 84, 96, 132, 240, 252, 396}.
- ❌ The fence-wait segment transforms cover only **5** keys {100, 156, 228, 252, 396}. The two sets OVERLAP at **only 252 and 396** — and 100/156/228 have NO captured glyph-fill, while {16…240} have NO transform. ⇒ **the segment's prim-13 draws and the guest's text-fill draws (lr=0x821F90B0) are DIFFERENT draw streams**; their vert-counts coincide only for the debug label (252). The count-key pairing (cont.73) therefore matches ONLY the debug label.
- ❌ The placed output `/tmp/cont73_placed_15.ppm` (the cumulative g_textFrame) is **entirely BLACK** — the one placed label (debug, T=334,866) is off-bottom (y=866), so nothing is visible.

**⇒ HONEST CEILING (corrects cont.86's "gap 1 is glyph capture"):** the real blocker is NOT capturing the glyphs (they ARE captured) — it is that **the fence-wait transform stream and the guest glyph-fill stream don't correspond** (different draw lists; count-matching is coincidental). Even the 2 overlapping labels are off-screen (cont.34 parks them). So the cont.73/85/86 count-pairing produces only an off-screen debug label = a black frame. The text-placement angle (cont.85-87) is capped, exactly as the render angle was (cont.84).

**⇒ CONSOLIDATION of the fence-wait arc (cont.80-87) — what is MAPPED vs what is WALLED:**
- MAPPED (real, durable): the title's real per-frame command stream = the build-cursor directory segment at the fence-wait (cont.80-81); its completion contract (fence 0xA2010000, build cursor device+13568 marching ~0x88880/frame, cont.80); its real draw STRUCTURE (prim-8 backdrop + prim-13 100/156/228/252/396-glyph text + prim-5 sprites, cont.81-85); a LIVE backdrop (cont.82-83, stride-8 screen quads); the real menu labels' game-accurate TRANSFORMS (cont.85, screen→NDC); SET_CONSTANT2 fetch-binding + ALU-const shadowing (cont.84-85). New gated diags REX_FRAMEBUF/FRAMEDRAW/FWPLACE + tools prod_submit/va_submit/prod_pc.gdb.
- WALLED (all gated on REAL GPU COMPLETION = the multi-week A↔B coupling, NO measured shortcut — confirmed from 3 independent angles): (1) the producer/consumer is completion BOOKKEEPING not the draw path (cont.76-79); (2) the content GEOMETRY is in unpopulated dynamic VBs (cont.59/84); (3) the title doesn't PROGRESS to the shown-menu state — it parks the labels off-screen (cont.34/85-87); and the segment transforms ≠ guest glyph streams (cont.87). Every render/placement angle converges on the title needing to SEE real GPU completion to build+submit+show its real frame.

**⭐NEXT (cont.88) — return to the ROOT (the only path to the visible result):** the prompt's §3-4 = build A (real renderer) + B (real completion) TOGETHER. Given the fence-wait arc has mapped the real stream + structure + transforms, the remaining lever is making the title SEE real completion so it progresses (cont.34) + builds the real content geometry (cont.59). Re-examine, with the new map: does executing the build-cursor segment AT the fence-wait (its real EVENT_WRITE_SHD fences + DRAW_INDX, not the blind fence-forward) advance the title's state (the cont.21 "execute the built fences" prescription, now with the real segment located)? That is the one untried high-leverage move the fence-wait map enables: not faking completion, but EXECUTING the real per-frame segment so its fences/events fire as real results. ⚠risky (side effects); gate; measure the title's progression (does it leave the off-left/attract state?). Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

## cont.88 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — EXECUTED the real build-cursor segment at the fence-wait (REX_FRAMEEXEC, cont.21's "execute the built fences" with the real segment located) — it is SAFE (no crash) and runs the real per-frame segment, but the title does NOT progress: device+0x2b04 still climbs (kick frozen), labels stay off-screen. The segment's INTERRUPT fires but the NULL producer-callback (cont.78) blocks the completion drain → confirms the A↔B wall from the segment-execution angle (5th independent angle)

The one untried high-leverage move from cont.87. CODE CHANGE (gated `REX_FRAMEEXEC`): at the fence-wait (sub_821C6E58), BEFORE the blind fence-forward, ExecutePM4 the build-cursor directory segment(s) — `lo=min(device+13568,device+13572) .. hi=max(...)`, walk the 0x81-descriptors, ExecutePM4 each segment — so its real EVENT_WRITE_SHD fences + INTERRUPT + DRAW_INDX fire (the fence advances as a REAL result, not a blind forward). Capped 30, GpuLock-serialized. Default boot UNREGRESSED (gated; 114k-line headless boot, 0 real crashes, `[frameexec]` absent when off).

**Result — SAFE but the title does NOT progress (measured):**
- ✅ Executing the segment at the fence-wait is SAFE: NO crash over 25s / 30 executions. `[frameexec]` ran 1 seg per fence-wait from the MARCHING build cursor (0xA0015DD8..0xA0090180 → 0xA009B50C..0xA0117B00 → 0xA01A0380..0xA01A8A68 → …). So the located real per-frame segment IS executable mid-frame without crashing.
- ❌ **The kick stays FROZEN:** device+0x2b04 still CLIMBS (the [cpcomplete] log shows 100→99, 112→111, **127→126** — it keeps growing, the kick-gate sample log was just capped at the early 4-5 values). Kicks stay deferred → the title never submits past the init ring.
- ❌ **The labels do NOT move on-screen:** [fwxform] still off-left (World.x=−183.5) / off-bottom (the 2 "ON-SCREEN" are the spurious proj=(0,0) draws). The title stays at the off-left/attract layout.

**⇒ WHY (the measured cause):** executing the segment fires its INTERRUPT (`FireGfxInterrupt source=1` → `sub_821C7170`), but the producer-callback `*(B+0x10)` is NULL (cont.78), so `sub_821C7170` has no producer to call → the producer/consumer completion handshake doesn't run → device+0x2b04 is NOT drained → the kick stays frozen. Executing the real segment ADVANCES the fence (the EVENT_WRITE_SHD) but NOT the pending-submission counter (which needs the completion handshake, cont.14-22). So executing the real per-frame segment is necessary-looking but NOT sufficient: the device+0x2b04 drain (B) still requires the producer/consumer handshake that the null callback blocks.

**⇒ The A↔B wall is now confirmed from FIVE independent angles (cont.76-88), all converging on the same root — real GPU completion requires the producer/consumer handshake to drain device+0x2b04, which requires the producer registered + real GPU results, with NO measured shortcut:** (1) producer/consumer is bookkeeping, driving it gives init rects + crash (cont.15-21/76-79); (2) the content GEOMETRY is in unpopulated dynamic VBs (cont.59/84); (3) the title doesn't progress to the shown-menu, parking labels off-screen (cont.34/85-87); (4) the segment transforms ≠ guest glyph streams (cont.87); (5) executing the real per-frame segment is safe but doesn't drain device+0x2b04 / unfreeze the kick (cont.88). This is the multi-week structural GPU-CP/completion build the prompt frames (§3-4), confirmed not autonomously-shortcuttable.

**⭐NEXT (cont.89) — the LAST untested combination, then consolidate:** frameexec (execute the real segment, cont.88) + REX_BOOTSTRAP (register the producer at `*(B+0x10)`, cont.14/78) TOGETHER — does executing the real segment WITH the producer registered let the INTERRUPT → producer → consumer → drain device+0x2b04 (kick unfreezes)? cont.22 tested CPCOMPLETE+PUMPCB (counter+producer) → 14 kicks then plateau, but NOT with the real located segment executed. If this also plateaus, the A↔B coupling is the genuine multi-week wall (confirmed exhaustively); the achievable deliverable is the guest-side content render (cont.65-75, real positions) + the fence-wait map (cont.80-88) as the foundation for the future deep CP build. ⚠gated; default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (REX_FRAMEEXEC gated; 114k-line boot, 0 crashes).

## cont.89 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — the LAST untested combination (frameexec + REX_BOOTSTRAP) ALSO PLATEAUS: the producer fires with a NULL work-item, device+0x2b04 climbs to 909, the kick stays frozen. The A↔B coupling is now EXHAUSTIVELY CONFIRMED as the multi-week structural wall (6 independent angles, no autonomous shortcut)

Ran REX_FRAMEEXEC=1 + REX_BOOTSTRAP=1 together (measurement; no code change, binary=cont.88, default boot trivially unregressed). The hypothesis: executing the real located segment (cont.88) WITH the producer registered (REX_BOOTSTRAP sets *(B+0x10)=0x821CC7A0, cont.14/78) would let the segment's INTERRUPT → sub_821C7170 → producer → consumer → DRAIN device+0x2b04 → unfreeze the kick.

**Result — ALSO PLATEAUS (no progression):** no crash. The producer DID fire (`[enq] #1 NEW item-type: item=0x0 vtable=0x0 *(item+16)=0x0`) — but with a **NULL work-item** (item=0x0): REX_BOOTSTRAP registered the callback `*(B+0x10)`, but `*(B+0x14)` (the work-item ctx) is null (cont.78), so the producer is invoked with empty work. The consumer ran once. And **device+0x2b04 STILL climbs to 909** (`[cpcomplete]` 842→841, 876→875, 909→908) → kicks stay deferred → the title does NOT progress. (cont.22's CPCOMPLETE+PUMPCB → 14-kick plateau; this — with the REAL located segment executed + the producer registered — also plateaus, closing that gap.)

**⇒ WHY (the circular root, exhaustively confirmed):** the producer/consumer can be DRIVEN (it fires), but with a **null work-item ctx** — because `*(B+0x14)` is populated only by a REAL GPU completion (the completion object B is filled by the GPU finishing real work). Without real GPU results there is no real work-item, so the producer/consumer run empty → no real drain of device+0x2b04 → the kick stays frozen → no real submission → no real GPU work → no real completion. The A↔B circle has NO autonomous bootstrap: every entry point (force the gate cont.15; drive the producer cont.17-22; drain the counter cont.21; execute the real segment cont.88; execute it + register the producer cont.89) hits the same missing piece — a REAL GPU result that only real command execution produces.

**═══ EXHAUSTIVE CONFIRMATION of the A↔B wall — 6 independent angles (cont.13-89), all converging on real GPU completion as the keystone, NO measured shortcut: ═══**
1. **Producer/consumer = completion BOOKKEEPING, not the draw path** (cont.13-22/76-79): driving it gives init=0x30088 rects + crash; `*(item+16)=0` is normal (null in prod too).
2. **Content GEOMETRY is in unpopulated dynamic VBs** (cont.59/61/84): the executed segment's content draws reference the dead slot-1 placeholder (0xA01FE0FC) / empty 0xA022FFF0; the real geometry is in the guest renderers' VBs, not the segment's fetch slots.
3. **The title doesn't PROGRESS to the shown-menu state** (cont.34/85-87): it parks the menu labels off-screen (World.x=−183.5) at attract/transition; the shown menu is gated on GPU completion.
4. **The segment transforms ≠ the guest glyph streams** (cont.87): the fence-wait prim-13 transforms {100,156,228,252,396} and the guest text-fills {16…396} are different draw lists, overlapping only at the (off-screen) debug label → count-pairing places only it → black frame.
5. **Executing the real per-frame segment is SAFE but doesn't drain device+0x2b04** (cont.88): the fence advances but the pending-counter doesn't.
6. **Executing the real segment + registering the producer ALSO plateaus** (cont.89): the producer fires with a null work-item; device+0x2b04 climbs to 909; the kick stays frozen.
⇒ **This is the project's structural-floor GPU command-processor / GPU-completion build** (prompt §3-4, GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN / RENDERER-DESIGN): a faithful CP that EXECUTES the title's per-frame stream AND models real GPU completion (fence + counter + the completion-object B work-item ctx) so the title's handshake oscillates and it keeps submitting its real content. It is genuinely multi-week and NOT autonomously shortcuttable (proven from 6 angles).

**═══ WHAT THE A2B-MONUMENTAL ARC (cont.76-89) DELIVERED — the MAPPED FOUNDATION for that build: ═══**
- **The real per-frame command stream LOCATED:** the build-cursor directory segment at the fence-wait (sub_821C6E58), `device+13568..13572`, marching ~0x88880/frame through 0xA00xxxxx (cont.80-81). NOT the frozen ring, NOT the recycled EXECSEGS-at-VdSwap snapshot, NOT device+13568-placeholder — the LIVE per-frame segment at the fence-wait sync point.
- **The completion contract MAPPED:** the fence at 0xA2010000 (`*(device+10896)`), head/target +6/frame; the kick-gate counter `device+0x2b04`; the completion object B (`*(device+10900)`) with `*(B+0x10)`=producer, `*(B+0x14)`=work-item ctx; the per-frame submit chain (init Main-XThread sub_821C7F08; steady render-XThread sub_82450FD0→sub_821CC5D0→sub_821CC310→kick) (cont.76-80).
- **The real draw STRUCTURE measured:** prim-8 backdrop (stride-8 screen quads tiling 1280×720, LIVE) + prim-13 text labels (100/156/228/252/396-glyph, with real screen→NDC transforms) + prim-5 sprites (cont.81-85).
- **The producer trigger:** a PM4 INTERRUPT (0x54) packet the title embeds in its per-frame IB; prod's CP fires it after the buffer's draws (cont.77).
- **Executable at the fence-wait (safe), SET_CONSTANT2 + ALU-const shadowing, the real menu labels' game-accurate transforms** (cont.84-88).
- New gated diags: REX_FRAMEBUF/FRAMEDRAW/FWPLACE/FRAMEEXEC; tools prod_submit/va_submit/prod_pc.gdb. Default boot UNREGRESSED throughout.

**⭐NEXT (cont.90) — CONSOLIDATE (the wall is exhaustively confirmed; re-probing is diminishing returns):** write the deep-CP build roadmap from the mapped foundation (update GPU-RESOURCE-BUILD-PLAN.md / a morning report) — the concrete pillar sequence the map now enables: (A) a faithful per-submission device+0x2b04 drain + completion-object B population (fill `*(B+0x14)` with the executed submission's ctx) so the producer fires with REAL work; (B) the DRAW_INDX→Vulkan translator on the fence-wait segment's executable draws; (C) the A↔B coupling iteration. Note honestly to the user: the visible game-accurate menu is the multi-week deep-CP build (mapped, not shortcuttable); the ACHIEVED visible deliverable remains the guest-side content render (cont.65-75: real-position splashes + decoded menu assets + readable menu text). Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

## cont.90 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — ⭐PILLAR-A ADVANCE: the FAITHFUL per-submission device+0x2b04 drain (REX_EWDRAIN, decrement on the segment's EVENT_WRITE_SHD) + REX_FRAMEEXEC UNFREEZES the kick-gate — the ring flows 61→373, device+0x2b04 oscillates 0↔1 (PROD-FAITHFUL), 44 kicks (vs cont.21's 14). But it plateaus at 373 with setup IBs only → re-confirms cont.22's "ring flow ≠ content" with the real located segment + faithful drain

Instead of consolidating prematurely, implemented the ONE cont.22-identified-but-never-built faithful mechanism. CODE CHANGE (gated `REX_EWDRAIN`): decrement the kick-gate counter `device+0x2b04` in the CP's `EVENT_WRITE_SHD` handler (a VS|PS-done fence = a real per-submission completion marker) — a PROD-FAITHFUL per-submission drain (prod oscillates 0↔1, cont.22) vs REX_CPCOMPLETE's blanket 1/vblank. With REX_FRAMEEXEC executing the real located segment (cont.88), its EVENT_WRITE_SHDs fire in the CP → drain the gate per real completion marker. Default boot UNREGRESSED (gated; 57k-line headless boot, 0 real crashes, EWDRAIN inactive when off).

**⭐RESULT — the kick-gate UNFREEZES (pillar A works, faithfully):**
- **The ring FLOWS past wptr=61 → 373** (12-13 ExecuteRing vs the frozen 6; rptr 217→265→313→361→373). The title submits ~8× more frames than the cont.21/78 frozen state.
- **device+0x2b04 oscillates 0↔1** — the PROD-FAITHFUL pattern (cont.22 measured prod cmax=1): `[kickgate]` #77=1 defer, #78=0 KICK, #79=0 KICK. **44 KICK vs 36 defer** (vs cont.21's 14 kicks / cont.78's ~6). The drain-RATE-mismatch runaway (cont.76's 671, cont.88-89's 909) is FIXED — the per-submission EVENT_WRITE_SHD drain keeps pace.
- ✅ This implements + validates cont.21/22 PILLAR A (faithful completion drain) — a real, keepable advance: the kick-gate is no longer the freeze.

**❌ BUT it re-confirms cont.22's "RING FLOW ≠ CONTENT" (now with the real segment + faithful drain):**
- The ring plateaus at **wptr=373** (the 22s and 30s runs both reach ~373 then stop advancing). **0 XE_SWAP.**
- ALL IBs are still SMALL SETUP buffers (**len ≤ 266 dw**, marching through phys 0xA00…0xA0F + 0xA20). The big CONTENT draw IB (prod's 3592-dw @ 0xBDC90540) NEVER appears.
- ⇒ exactly cont.22 §2: across kick rates (6 frozen / 14 cont.21 / 44 cont.90 / 2725 forced cont.15) the title builds only setup/init draws — MORE ring flow does NOT produce content. The title submits ~more setup frames then plateaus because it needs the FULLER completion handshake (real GPU results: the producer/consumer with a REAL work-item ctx, cont.89; real rendered output) before it builds + submits its CONTENT draw IBs.

**⇒ REFINED STATE (pillar A now DONE faithfully):** the kick-gate freeze (the B-completion counter) is SOLVED — REX_EWDRAIN drains device+0x2b04 per-submission, prod-faithfully (0↔1), and the ring flows (61→373). The remaining wall is unchanged in nature but sharper: the title plateaus at setup because the FULLER A↔B handshake is unmet — it needs (a) the producer to fire with a REAL work-item (cont.89: `*(B+0x14)` populated by real completion) AND (b) real GPU output (pillar B: DRAW_INDX→Vulkan) so the title sees its frame complete and advances to content. So: pillar A ✓ (faithful drain, kick flows); pillar B + the work-item-ctx population = the remaining multi-week structural work (the A↔B coupling, cont.21-22/76-89).

**⭐NEXT (cont.91):** the title plateaus at wptr=373 with setup IBs — measure WHAT it's waiting for at the plateau (gdb all-thread bt of the main thread at the 373-plateau with REX_EWDRAIN: is it the segment-pointer fence sub_821C5DF0, the completion-spin sub_821C6F50, or a resource/subsystem gate?) to find the NEXT specific gate past the (now-solved) kick-gate. Then attack that gate (the next link in the A↔B coupling). Pillar A (REX_EWDRAIN) is a keepable foundation — consider making it default-on with REX_FRAMEEXEC once the next gate is understood. ⚠gated; default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (REX_EWDRAIN gated; 57k-line boot, 0 crashes).

## cont.91 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — ⭐pillar A (REX_EWDRAIN) PROGRESSES the title's LOGIC past the cont.22 movie/attract state: the gdb plateau backtrace shows the frontend now running the menu/L1-transition handler sub_8211B740 (the cont.30-31 asset-loader, actively SIMD-decompressing) — NOT dead-stalled. The next gate is sub_8211B740's processing (load-completion vs loop), not the kick-gate

MEASUREMENT (gdb on cont.90's binary, REX_FRAMEEXEC+REX_EWDRAIN; no code change, default boot trivially unregressed). New tool `varianta/tools/plateau.gdb`: run variant A with pillar A active, break the fence-wait sub_821C6E58, dump an ALL-THREAD backtrace at the wptr=373 plateau (hits #1500 + #5000).

**The plateau is NOT a dead stall — the title is actively PROGRESSING its frontend logic:**
- **One thread is RUNNING the menu/L1-transition handler:** `sub_82150970 (frontend) → sub_8211B740 → sub_82132918 → sub_8212F6F0 → sub_822C14E8 (simde_mm_shuffle_epi8, SIMD)`. **sub_8211B740 is the cont.30-31/35 menu-transition + asset-loader** (cont.31: "loads Level 1, 162 assets" via the cont.30 CLAMPCPY); the SIMD shuffle = asset/resource DECOMPRESSION. So with pillar A the title has advanced PAST the cont.22 frontend-stuck-on-the-MOVIE-widget state (cont.22 bt: sub_82150970 → … → sub_82425BF8 movie widget) to the MENU/L1 TRANSITION processing.
- The render thread waits in the fence-wait `sub_821C6E58` (kernel.cpp:3600); other threads wait in `WaitObject` (kernel.cpp:1183, guest events obj=882132/882116/171328) / `NtWaitForMultipleObjectsEx` (kernel.cpp:4957). The ring plateaus at wptr=373 while the transition handler processes (CPU asset-load work, not yet submitting content draws).
- Active guest fns across both samples: sub_8211B740 + sub_82132918 (the transition), sub_82150970 (frontend), sub_821BFF48 (post-frame GPU sync), sub_82249678 (subsys chain).

**⇒ pillar A (REX_EWDRAIN) didn't just flow the ring — it UNBLOCKED the title's frontend to RUN the menu/L1 transition (sub_8211B740) that was previously gated behind the frozen kick.** The ring plateau at 373 is the transition handler doing its asset-load/decompress work (CPU), not a hard wall. The NEXT gate is INSIDE sub_8211B740 — is it (a) progressing toward completing the load (→ then it submits the content draw IBs, the real breakthrough), or (b) looping/stuck on a resource it can't complete (the cont.30-43 loader gates / a GPU-result it still needs)? sub_8211B740 appears in BOTH samples (#1500 + #5000, seconds apart) — so it's running SUSTAINED (a long load OR a loop).

**⭐NEXT (cont.92):** trace sub_8211B740's progress with pillar A active — is it ADVANCING (asset count climbing, the cont.31 162-asset load completing) or LOOPING? Add a gated counter/trace on sub_8211B740 + its asset-load (the cont.30-31 CLAMPCPY / sub_8211BE68 resource-fetch, REX_RESID) → does the L1/menu load COMPLETE under pillar A? If it completes, does the title then submit the content draw IBs (ring past 373 + a large IB)? If it loops, find what it re-requests (the cont.33 null gameplay subsystem / cont.43 hidden creator). This is the next concrete link in the A↔B chain, now reachable because pillar A moved the title forward. ⚠gated; default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

## cont.92 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — ⭐pillar A CASCADES further: the loader ADVANCES — the cont.27-28 STUCK resource-fetch (sub_8211BE68) now COMPLETES (be68call 6 ENTER / 6 RET), and the title LOADS the Level-1 gameplay assets (14 .bin files: WallTextures/PickupTextures/StructureTextures/ParticleTextures + Global.bin meshes). But the ring still plateaus at 373 (CPU asset-load phase; render not started). The next gate = what STARTS the content render (the cont.33 gameplay subsystem / cont.34 GPU-completion)

MEASUREMENT (cont.90's binary, REX_FRAMEEXEC+REX_EWDRAIN + loader diags; no code change, default boot trivially unregressed).

**pillar A unblocks the LOADER (past the cont.27-28 stuck-fetch wall):**
- **The resource-fetch sub_8211BE68 — which cont.27-28 found ENTERed but NEVER RETurned (stuck on a corrupted r31 resource-path across the vtable[11] poll) — now COMPLETES:** `[be68call]` 6 ENTER / **6 RET** (all return). The advance-gate fetch is no longer stuck under pillar A.
- **The title LOADS the real Level-1 / gameplay assets:** `[resid]` job = `Assets\Global\Meshes\Global.bin` + `Assets/Levels/…`; 14 asset .bin files OPENED (NtCreateFile): Global.bin (meshes + textures), Strings.bin, **WallTextures.bin, PickupTextures.bin, StructureTextures.bin, ParticleTextures.bin** — the Tower-Defense GAMEPLAY textures. [clampcpy] fires (the cont.30 in-poll sentinel) → the load advances. sub_8211B740 ran (work-handler), tid=10 consumer running.
- ⇒ pillar A cascaded the title FORWARD: frozen-at-attract (cont.78) → kick unfrozen (cont.90) → menu/L1-transition (cont.91) → **LOADING the L1 gameplay assets (cont.92), past the cont.22/27-28 loader walls.**

**❌ BUT the ring still plateaus at wptr=373** (max wptr=373, 12 ExecuteRing, 0 XE_SWAP, all IBs len≤266 setup) — the title is in the **CPU asset-LOAD phase** (file I/O + decompress), it has NOT started RENDERING the loaded content (no content draw IBs submitted yet). So the asset load progresses but the render is gated on the NEXT link.

**⇒ The chain so far (pillar A cascading through the gates):** kick-gate freeze (cont.13-90) → SOLVED (REX_EWDRAIN). Frontend stuck on the movie/attract (cont.22) → ADVANCED to the menu/L1 transition (cont.91). The stuck advance-gate fetch (cont.27-28) → COMPLETES, L1 assets LOAD (cont.92). The NEXT gate: the title loads the content but doesn't render it — what STARTS the content render? The known candidates downstream of the L1 load (cont.33-34): the **null gameplay subsystem** `*(0x827FD56C)` (cont.33/53: created by sub_8248F4C8, but its init failed on XamUserReadProfileSettings — fixed behind REX_SUBSYS, which then exposes the NtCreateTimer stub, cont.53) and the **post-L1 GPU-completion spin** sub_821C6F50 (cont.34, reg 0xC0003C00). With the kick-gate now solved (pillar A), re-test whether REX_SUBSYS (+ a timer primitive) lets the loaded L1 start rendering.

**⭐NEXT (cont.93):** run pillar A (REX_FRAMEEXEC+REX_EWDRAIN) + REX_SUBSYS (create the gameplay subsystem, cont.53) + REX_SUBSYS's needed timer (cont.53-54: the tid=10/subsys worker blocks on NtCreateTimer/NtSetTimerEx — implement/stub a real-enough host timer) → does the loaded L1 then START rendering (ring past 373, a large content IB, XE_SWAP, or the post-L1 spin sub_821C6F50 advancing)? The kick-gate is no longer the blocker; the next gate is the gameplay-subsystem/render-start. Also measure: does the asset load COMPLETE (all 162, cont.31) under pillar A, or stall partway? ⚠gated; default boot unregressed. Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

## cont.93 (2026-06-07, /loop A2B-MONUMENTAL, autonomous) — ⭐pillar A + REX_SUBSYS: the gameplay subsystem is created WITHOUT the cont.53 early stall (pillar A advanced the title past it), but the subsys worker now blocks on the STUBBED TIMER (NtCreateTimer/NtSetTimerEx) — the next gate in the cascade. The TIMER PRIMITIVE is the cont.94 work (a host timer thread that SignalObject's the worker's timer object)

MEASUREMENT (cont.90's binary, REX_FRAMEEXEC+REX_EWDRAIN + REX_SUBSYS; no code change, default boot trivially unregressed). REX_SUBSYS (cont.53) creates the post-L1 gameplay subsystem `*(0x827FD56C)` (the cont.33 null gate).

**Result — the subsystem creates cleanly (pillar A removed cont.53's caveat), the timer is the next gate:**
- **NO early stall:** 277k lines, 0 crashes (vs cont.53's REX_SUBSYS-alone stall at frontend-init = 654 lines). ⇒ pillar A advanced the title PAST the point where cont.53's REX_SUBSYS stalled — the subsystem worker now spawns + runs (rather than blocking frontend-init).
- **The subsys worker blocks on the STUBBED TIMER:** `[stub] NtCreateTimer` + `[stub] NtSetTimerEx` fire. cont.53-54: the gameplay-subsystem worker (tid=10, start sub_824C6ED0) creates + waits on a timer (NtCreateTimer/NtSetTimerEx) to drive its per-tick work; the stubs no-op → the worker's timer-wait never wakes → the worker doesn't run its render/gameplay tick.
- The ring barely advances (wptr 373→**379**, 8 ExecuteRing, 0 XE_SWAP, IBs len≤266) — the worker is timer-blocked, so the gameplay/render tick hasn't started.

**⇒ The cascade's NEXT gate = the TIMER PRIMITIVE (cont.54's identified work):** the mechanism is now clear (kernel.cpp: `SignalObject(obj,state)` signals a guest dispatch object + notifies g_waitCv; `WaitObject(obj,timeoutMs)` waits; `KeSetEvent` → SignalObject). NtCreateTimer/NtSetTimerEx are weak STUBS (just print [stub]). To unblock the worker: implement `__imp__NtCreateTimer` (create a guest timer dispatch object / handle) + `__imp__NtSetTimerEx` (schedule a HOST timer thread to `SignalObject(timerObj, 1)` after the due-time, + periodic re-signal for periodic timers) — so the worker's `KeWaitForSingleObject(timer)` wakes per tick and runs its gameplay/render work.

**⇒ The cascade so far (pillar A walking the gate-chain forward):** kick-gate freeze (cont.13-90) → SOLVED (REX_EWDRAIN). Movie/attract stuck (cont.22) → menu/L1 transition (cont.91). Stuck advance-fetch (cont.27-28) → completes, L1 assets LOAD (cont.92). Gameplay-subsystem null (cont.33/53) → CREATED cleanly under pillar A (cont.93). NEXT: the timer (cont.53-54) → the subsys worker's per-tick render. Each gate the prior continuations hit IN ISOLATION is now being walked through IN SEQUENCE because pillar A keeps the GPU-submission flowing.

**⭐NEXT (cont.94) — IMPLEMENT THE TIMER (cont.54):** add `__imp__NtCreateTimer` + `__imp__NtSetTimerEx` (+ NtCancelTimer) as real PPC_FUNC overrides — NtCreateTimer returns a guest timer object (model on the existing object-create / handle system, e.g. NtCreateEvent); NtSetTimerEx spawns/arms a host std::thread that sleeps the due-time then `SignalObject(timer, 1)` (re-arming for periodic). Gate behind a flag (or fold into REX_SUBSYS). MEASURE: does the subsys worker (tid=10) then RUN its tick (gdb bt: leaves the timer-wait) → does the ring advance past 379 / a content draw IB appear / XE_SWAP fire / the post-L1 spin sub_821C6F50 advance? ⚠verify default boot UNREGRESSED (the timer must be benign when the title doesn't need it). Default boot UNREGRESSED (no code change this iter).

———— cont.94 — TIMER IMPLEMENTED (NtCreateTimer/NtSetTimerEx/NtCancelTimer real PPC_FUNC + host std::thread) ————

**ONE CHANGE this iter:** implemented the timer trio as real PPC_FUNC overrides in kernel.cpp (after NtPulseEvent, ~line 5001), modeled on the existing `__imp__NtCreateEvent` object/handle pattern (AllocObject(0x20), dispatch type +0x00, signal_state +0x04, wait_list self-ref +0x08/+0x0C):
- `__imp__NtCreateTimer` — AllocObject(0x20) + g_nextHandle, stores handle to *r3. Always active (default boot creates the object; harmless).
- `__imp__NtSetTimerEx` — gated behind **REX_TIMER**. Parses the due-time (r4 → 64-bit, negative = relative 100ns units → firstMs, clamped 0..5000) and period (r9 ms, clamped 0..60000). Spawns a host `std::thread`: sleep(firstMs) → `SignalObject(obj,1)`; if periodic, loop sleep(periodMs) → SignalObject until stop. HostTimer struct kept in `g_hostTimers[obj]`; StopHostTimer sets `stop` + detaches (struct intentionally leaked, bounded — thread reads `ht->stop` which is never freed → no UAF).
- `__imp__NtCancelTimer` — StopHostTimer(obj), zeroes *r4.

**BUILD/BOOT:** build clean (113k lines). Two build errors fixed en route: (1) `extern "C" PPC_FUNC(...)` forward-decls conflicted with generated `PPC_EXTERN_FUNC` ("different language linkage") → removed the forward-decls (the NtCreateEvent override doesn't use them either). (2) lifetime: original `delete ht` was a UAF risk → switched to never-delete (leak the bounded struct). Default boot with REX_TIMER OFF = stub-equivalent (object created, never fires) → **UNREGRESSED**, 0 crashes.

**MEASURE (full chain `REX_FRAMEEXEC=1 REX_EWDRAIN=1 REX_SUBSYS=1 REX_TIMER=1 REX_CPTRACE=1`, timeout -s KILL):**
- Timer ARMS correctly: `NtSetTimerEx obj=0x904000A0 first=10ms period=10ms (host timer armed)` — the title's real 10ms tick. No crash; the host thread fires SignalObject(0x904000A0,1) every 10ms.
- BUT **ring STILL plateaus at wptr=373** (12 ExecuteRing, 0 XE_SWAP, IB lengths ≤266) — same plateau as cont.93. The timer firing did NOT push a content draw IB into the ring.
- gdb plateau bt (plateau.gdb, now env REX_SUBSYS+REX_TIMER): a thread is running **`sub_8242BF10`** (cont.64-65 VB-fill = draw-BUILDING work) plus the subsys/frontend chains. So the worker IS being ticked by the timer and IS doing render-building work (filling vertex buffers) — but the built draws don't reach the CP/ring.

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS:** the timer is NOT the final gate. With the timer firing, the subsys worker leaves its `KeWaitForSingleObject(timer)` and runs its per-tick body (sub_8242BF10 VB fill = real render-building). Yet content still doesn't reach the command processor — the render-START (the actual draw submission into the per-frame command stream) is gated on a FURTHER link downstream of the VB-fill. cont.22's invariant holds again: **ring flow ≠ content draw.** The built vertex data sits in a buffer; something must KICK it into a DRAW_INDX in the build-cursor segment, and that kick is still blocked.

**⭐NEXT (cont.95) — FIND THE RENDER-START GATE PAST THE TIMER:** gdb-bt the subsys worker (tid≈10, sub_824C6ED0) to CONFIRM it leaves the timer-wait each 10ms tick (vs. still parked) — then trace from sub_8242BF10 (VB fill, which we SEE running) FORWARD: why doesn't the filled VB become a DRAW_INDX submission into the build-cursor segment? Prime suspect = the **cont.34 post-L1 GPU-completion spin `sub_821C6F50`** (polls reg 0xC0003C00) — if the worker's render path spins waiting on a GPU-completion value that variant A never advances, the draw is emitted only AFTER that spin clears. Measure: does sub_821C6F50 get hit on the subsys worker thread? what value does it poll, and what would advance it (prod-oracle: gdb the prod build at the same callsite, read the completion value it waits on)? Default boot UNREGRESSED (REX_TIMER gated; 113k-line boot, 0 crashes — the timer object is created but never fires unless REX_TIMER=1).

———— cont.95 — RENDER-SUBMIT PATH (sub_821F8E60) NEVER ENTERED; the cont.94 "VB-fill = render-building" was IMPRECISE ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change; new tool varianta/tools/renderpath.gdb):** under the FULL chain (REX_FRAMEEXEC+EWDRAIN+SUBSYS+TIMER), break the three render-path nodes and capture WHICH THREAD + full caller chain at each: sub_8242BF10 (the VB-fill memcpy we "saw" in cont.94), sub_821F8E60 (the cont.55 D3D dynamic-VB text-render path: vtable+200 obj → Lock(vtable+120) → sub_8242BF10 fill → Unlock(vtable+124) whose GPU-submit is stubbed), sub_821C6F50 (cont.34/54 per-frame GPU-cmd build, reg 0xC0003C00).

**RESULT — three findings:**
1. **sub_821F8E60 = 0 HITS.** The cont.55 per-draw D3D render-submit path is NEVER entered under the full chain. (Breakpoint armed at 0x865cb0 ppc_recomp.21:22260, resolved fine, never fired — the first-hit capture would have printed and didn't.) ⇒ the title never reaches the per-draw menu/text render-submit at all. The gate is UPSTREAM of the cont.55 stubbed Unlock-submit.
2. **The sub_8242BF10 fills we "saw" are STARTUP memcpys, not render.** All 3 captured hits are on **thread 1** via the C-runtime startup chain: `__xstart → sub_82450580/sub_824504A8 → sub_8244B380 → sub_8242CCB0 → sub_8242BF10` (hit #1) and `__xstart → sub_82450350 → PPCInvokeGuest → sub_825902B8/sub_82590348 → sub_8242BF10` (hits #2-3). sub_8242BF10 is a GENERIC memcpy (cont.65) used by BOTH startup AND the cont.55 VB-fill — and what's firing here is the startup use. ⇒ **cont.94's "the subsys worker does VB-fill render-building via sub_8242BF10" was IMPRECISE** — the generic memcpy firing ≠ the render path running. SELF-CORRECTION (measure don't speculate).
3. **sub_821C6F50 (per-frame GPU-cmd build) runs on thread 6** (hit ≥2×). This is the render-command-building thread; it runs but doesn't dispatch the per-draw render-submit (finding #1).

**SECONDARY OBS:** at the plateau, gdb logs a tight repeated ping-pong between exactly two threads — worker **LWP 877018** (0x7ffef2c1c6c0) ↔ main **LWP 876909** (0x7ffff7d2b800) — a possible 2-thread spin/handoff (or gdb scheduler noise; needs a bt of both to confirm).

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS:** the render-START gate is UPSTREAM of the cont.55 per-draw submit, NOT the submit-stub itself. The title's render-command-build loop (sub_821C6F50, thread 6) runs, but the frontend never DISPATCHES the menu/text per-draw render path (sub_821F8E60) — so the question is no longer "why doesn't the Unlock emit a DRAW_INDX" (cont.55, that path isn't even reached) but "what gates ENTRY into sub_821F8E60". That entry is presumably gated on the frontend state machine reaching "menu active/visible", which the plateau ping-pong (worker↔main) is the live face of. cont.22's invariant once more: ring flow ≠ content — and now we know content's per-draw path isn't even entered.

**⭐NEXT (cont.96) — WHAT GATES ENTRY INTO sub_821F8E60 (the per-draw render):** bt BOTH plateau ping-pong threads (LWP 877018 worker ↔ 876909 main) to see what they spin/handoff on; and set a one-shot/conditional breakpoint UPSTREAM of sub_821F8E60 (its caller sub_82250420→sub_8211B740 chain, cont.22) to find WHERE the menu-render dispatch is decided and what flag/state it tests that variant A leaves unsatisfied (prod-oracle: gdb prod at the same callsite — what does prod have set there that variant A doesn't?). Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.95 = measurement only, new gdb tool renderpath.gdb; no code change).

———— cont.96 — ⚠️CORRECTION OF cont.95: the per-draw render path IS entered; cont.95's "0 hits" was a gdb THROTTLE ARTIFACT ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change; new tool varianta/tools/dispatch.gdb):** static analysis first — sub_821F8E60's ONLY callers are inside **sub_821F8488** (ppc_recomp.21:21874 + 22228), a per-draw render LOOP. So I broke the dispatcher (sub_821F8488) + the callee (sub_821F8E60) under the full chain — but this time WITHOUT breaking the hot sub_8242BF10 memcpy.

**RESULT — cont.95 OVERTURNED:**
- **sub_821F8488 (dispatcher) AND sub_821F8E60 (per-draw render) are BOTH hit** — early and repeatedly, on thread 1 (≥4 dispatcher, ≥2 callee in the captured window before SIGKILL). sub_821F8E60 bt frame #1 = sub_821F8488:22228 — confirmed it's the real per-draw render call, not some other use. r3=0x060FD8C0 r4=0x000E5100 (consistent across hits = the render object + a size/id).
- **⚠️ cont.95's "sub_821F8E60 = 0 hits / render-submit never entered" was a MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT.** The only difference between renderpath.gdb (0 hits) and dispatch.gdb (hit) is that renderpath.gdb ALSO broke **sub_8242BF10** — a HOT memcpy hit thousands of times during startup asset-decompression. Even a silent breakpoint stops-the-world + services + continues per hit; at that hit-rate it throttled gdb so severely the 55s run never progressed past startup to the steady-state menu render. (Tell: renderpath.gdb's sub_8242BF10 hits were all __xstart startup memcpys — the title was still in C-runtime init when the clock ran out.) So cont.95's headline is WRONG; self-correct.

**FULL MENU RENDER CALL CHAIN (now mapped, variant A, thread 1):**
`sub_82225D50 → sub_82226AD0 → sub_82227450 → sub_82213150 →[PPCInvokeGuest]→ sub_822170E8 → sub_8222E2B0 → sub_8222D808 → sub_821FB228 → sub_821F8488(dispatcher) → sub_821F8E60(per-draw render)`. The menu/UI per-draw render dispatch runs LIVE on the main thread.

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS (the gate REVERTS to cont.55/cont.22):** the per-draw render path IS reached and EXECUTES — so the wall is NOT "render never dispatched" (cont.95's wrong turn). It is the long-characterized cont.55 **stubbed D3D draw-submit** (sub_821F8E60's Unlock vtable+124 EXECUTES but emits no PM4 DRAW_INDX) + cont.22 **vertex-path gap** (slot-0 0xA2000000 never written). The executed draws don't translate into a content DRAW_INDX in the live command stream → plateau 373 / 0 XE_SWAP. **The cascade (cont.90-96) has walked the full live title all the way back to the ORIGINAL cont.22/55 render-submit→PM4 wall — but now REACHED with the complete title running (not in isolation).** That wall (make sub_821F8E60's executed draw emit a real bind+DRAW_INDX into the build-cursor segment) is the true remaining work.

**METHODOLOGY LESSON (logged to memory):** never break a HOT function (memcpy/alloc/per-instruction) with gdb `commands`+continue — it throttles the whole run and produces false "never reached" negatives for anything downstream. Break only cold/structural functions; for hot paths use a counter inside the runtime (a gated KTRACE), not a gdb breakpoint.

**⭐NEXT (cont.97) — RE THE EXECUTED-DRAW→PM4 GAP AT sub_821F8E60 (cont.55, now with the live title):** instrument sub_821F8E60's submit — does it call Lock(vtable+120)/Unlock(vtable+124)? what does the Unlock (the inlined-D3D submit) DO — does it reach the build-cursor segment / emit any PM4? Use a RUNTIME gated trace (REX flag + KTRACE inside the sub_821F8E60 hook or the vtable+124 callsite), NOT a gdb breakpoint (hot path). prod-oracle: find sub_821F8E60's host address in prod (or the equiv submit), confirm prod's Unlock emits a DRAW_INDX that variant A's doesn't. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.96 = measurement only, new gdb tool dispatch.gdb; no code change).

———— cont.97 — ⚠️REFINES cont.55: the vtable+124 "submit" (sub_822052F8) is a FAITHFUL tiny VB-Unlock, NOT a stubbed draw-submit; the DRAW_INDX emit is ELSEWHERE ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change; new tool varianta/tools/submit_probe.gdb):** static read first — sub_821F8E60's body (ppc_recomp.21:22553-22623) is the cont.55 D3D dynamic-VB pattern: vtable+200 (get obj, 22553) → vtable+120 (Lock, 22576-81) → sub_8242BF10 fill (22594) → vtable+124 (Unlock/"submit", 22600-05) → vtable+60 on r31 with r4=0 (SetTexture(0), 22611-23). To get the ACTUAL guest method behind vtable+124 (which cont.55 couldn't name), I captured it ONE-SHOT (self-disabling gdb breakpoints — services 1 hit, NO throttle, per the cont.96 lesson).

**CAPTURE (clean, one-shot):** r30 (VB/draw obj) = 0x000E36A0, vtable-base = 0x820E0B10; **Lock (vtable+120) = sub_822052B0**; **submit/Unlock (vtable+124) = sub_822052F8**.

**RE OF sub_822052F8 (the "submit" — ppc_recomp.23:1990):** NOT a kernel stub (no override in kernel.cpp; real recompiled code). Its ENTIRE body is 4 instructions:
```
r11 = *(r3+12)            // r3=r30 (VB obj); r11 = *(obj+12) = parent device/state ptr
r3  = 0                   // return 0 (success)
r10 = *(r11+13652)        // load dev+13652
*(r11+48) = r10           // store -> dev+48
return
```
⇒ it's a faithful tiny **VB-Unlock** that just copies dev+13652→dev+48 and returns success. It emits **NO PM4, NO DRAW_INDX**, touches no command buffer — and was NEVER meant to (an Unlock releases the lock; it doesn't draw).

**⚠️ REFINES cont.55:** cont.55 called vtable+124 "the draw-submit, stubbed (emits no PM4)". That conflated two things. vtable+124 is NOT stubbed (it's faithful) and NOT the draw-submit (it's the VB-unlock). So sub_821F8E60 = a **VB-fill → unlock → SetTexture(0)** helper (the SetTexture(0)/r4=0 at 22613 = the cont.45 tex=0x0). The actual **DrawPrimitive→DRAW_INDX emit is a SEPARATE call, NOT here** — it's emitted somewhere after the VB is filled+unlocked (most likely in the per-draw loop sub_821F8488 right after the sub_821F8E60 call at :22228, or a DrawIndexedPrimitive helper). cont.55's "missing link = SetStreamSource+DrawPrimitive that binds r30 into slot-0" (line 2741) was the RIGHT instinct; cont.97 rules OUT vtable+124 as that link and re-points at the separate draw call.

**⇒ The chain is now precise:** the menu render runs (cont.96: sub_821F8488→sub_821F8E60 live on thread 1); sub_821F8E60 fills+unlocks the VB and sets tex=0 — but the DRAW_INDX that consumes that VB is a distinct call still to be located. The plateau (0 content DRAW_INDX in the ring) means that distinct draw call either (a) doesn't run, or (b) runs but its PM4-emit doesn't reach the build-cursor segment.

**⭐NEXT (cont.98) — LOCATE THE ACTUAL DRAW CALL (DrawPrimitive→DRAW_INDX):** static-read sub_821F8488's body right after the sub_821F8E60 call (:22228) + at :21874 — find the DrawIndexedPrimitive/DrawPrimitive call (a vtable method on the device r31 that writes the DRAW_INDX opcode 0x22/0x36 to the command buffer). Capture its guest method addr ONE-SHOT (like cont.97), RE it: does it WRITE a DRAW_INDX to the build-cursor segment? If it runs but writes to a buffer that REX_FRAMEEXEC isn't executing, that's the gap; if it doesn't run, find its guard. prod-oracle: the same method in prod emits the draw. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.97 = measurement only, new gdb tool submit_probe.gdb; no code change).

———— cont.98 — sub_821F8E60 is a per-primitive VB-ACCUMULATE helper in a BATCHED UI renderer; the DRAW_INDX is a DEFERRED BATCH FLUSH (not in the fill chain) ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change; new tool varianta/tools/vtmap.gdb):** to find the draw, mapped sub_821F8E60's COMPLETE call set — 8 vtable methods (captured ONE-SHOT, self-disabling, no throttle) + 1 direct (sub_8242BF10 fill). Render obj r3=**0x000E50F0**:
- vt+20 = sub_821FF660, vt+24 = sub_821FF728, dev+17704 = sub_821FFC70 (early setup/getters)
- vt+60 = sub_821FFB10 (**SetTexture**, cont.54; r4=tex 0x060FEE90, later 0)
- vt+64 = sub_821FFC90 (state setter; r4=0 → no-op path)
- vt+100 = sub_821FEC40 (**STATS ACCUMULATOR**: `*(obj+188)+=r4; *(obj+192)+=r5; *(obj+196)+=1` — r4=0x3F=**63 verts** tallied, +196 = a **draw/prim count**)
- vt+200 = sub_82200178 (**getter**: `return *(obj+332)` = the batch VB ptr)
- vt+120 = sub_822052B0 (Lock, cont.97), vt+124 = sub_822052F8 (Unlock, cont.97 — no PM4)

**RE'd each candidate — NONE is a DRAW_INDX emit.** vt+100 is a count accumulator (tallies 63 verts + increments a prim-count), vt+200 is a one-line VB getter, vt+64 is a state setter, vt+120/124 are Lock/Unlock. So **sub_821F8E60 = a per-primitive VB-FILL + ACCUMULATE helper** (SetTexture → tally counts → get VB → Lock → fill 63 verts → Unlock → SetTexture(0)). Its parents are also NOT draws: **sub_821F8488** (VB-fill wrapper, returns the result) and **sub_821FB228** (CriticalSection-locked fill: RtlEnter → sub_821F8488 → RtlLeaveCriticalSection).

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS — BATCHED UI RENDERER:** the whole fill chain (sub_82225D50→…→sub_821FB228→sub_821F8488→sub_821F8E60) ACCUMULATES quads into a shared batch VB (`*(obj+332)`) and TALLIES vert/prim counts (obj+188/+192/+196). The actual **DrawIndexedPrimitive→DRAW_INDX is a DEFERRED BATCH FLUSH** — a separate function that READS the accumulated counts and issues ONE draw for the whole batch, triggered at end-of-frame / on a texture-or-state change / when the batch fills. That flush is NOT in the fill chain, which is exactly why cont.96-97's per-draw-path tracing never reached a draw-emit: the emit is elsewhere by design. (This finally explains the plateau: the batch is filled but the flush that turns it into a ring DRAW_INDX is the missing/un-executed step.)

**⭐NEXT (cont.99) — FIND THE BATCH FLUSH (the real DRAW_INDX emit):** locate the function that READS obj+196/+188 (the accumulated prim/vert counts on obj 0x000E50F0) and issues SetStreamSource(VB=*(obj+332)) + DrawIndexedPrimitive. Approaches: (a) static — grep the recompiled code for READS of +196/+332 on this object class (the flush consumes what the accumulator produces); (b) runtime — a one-shot/gated capture of the device's DrawIndexedPrimitive (the PM4 DRAW_INDX writer) to get its addr + caller; (c) the flush likely fires at frame-end (near the Swap/Present or the sub_821C6E58 fence path) or on the SetTexture state-change (vt+60 with a NEW texture forces a flush of the prior batch). prod-oracle: the flush fires in prod (the menu renders) — find it there and compare. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.98 = measurement only, new gdb tool vtmap.gdb; no code change).

———— cont.99 — static offset-matching for the flush is UNRELIABLE (offset collisions); located the orchestrator frame; KEY ENABLER: prod has FULL symbols → prod-oracle unblocked ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change, no new tool — static analysis + prod symbol check):** hunted the batch flush (cont.98) by static offset-matching — readers of the accumulator's +188 (vert count) / +196 (prim count) / +332 (batch VB) on the render-ctx obj.

**RESULT — three findings:**
1. **Static offset-matching is UNRELIABLE here (offset collisions).** The accumulator's data fields (+188/+192/+196) collide with VTABLE-SLOT offsets of OTHER object classes. e.g. the only "+188 reader" outside the accumulator, sub_821FE5B8, does `r11=*(r3+0); r11=*(r11+188); bctrl` — that's `*(vtable+188)` = a vtable[47] METHOD CALL, not the accumulator's vert-count field. The accumulator's data +196 is read ONLY by the accumulator itself. ⇒ can't locate the flush by matching the producer's field offsets — the search is confounded by data-field vs vtable-slot collisions. (Methodology caveat logged.)
2. **Located the ORCHESTRATOR frame: sub_8222D808** (ppc_recomp.27:14066-15392, the frame that calls the CS-locked fill sub_821FB228). It calls the fill TWICE (14431, 15272) and interleaves render-class calls — notably **sub_821FB340 (14466) right AFTER the first fill** (a "fill→X" pattern; sub_821FB340 is adjacent to sub_821FB228 in address space; calls sub_821F79D0), plus sub_8221FA08 (14490→sub_8221BC10/sub_82227C08) and sub_822045E0 (15029). These are flush/draw candidates — but NONE has an obvious device-draw indirect call, so pure static reading is inconclusive for which emits the DRAW_INDX.
3. **⭐KEY ENABLER — PROD HAS FULL SYMBOLS:** `nm south_park_td` → 30314 `sub_` symbols (e.g. `__imp__sub_821F8E60` @ host 0x784010, sub_821F8488 @ 0x781e00, sub_821FEC40 @ 0x797f90, both T and W). So the prod-oracle can break the EXACT SAME guest functions BY NAME in prod (prod renders the menu → its flush FIRES). The flush is the SAME guest function in both builds (recompiled from the same code) — so finding it in prod = finding it in variant A.

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS:** the flush is real but not findable by static field-offset matching (collisions) or quick call-graph reading (inconclusive). The decisive tool is now unblocked: **prod-oracle by symbol name.**

**⭐NEXT (cont.100) — PROD-ORACLE THE FLUSH:** run prod (DISPLAY=:0, prod_pc.gdb env/args) with breakpoints by NAME on the render chain + the flush candidates. (a) break sub_821F8E60 (one-shot deep bt 24) to confirm prod's render chain == variant A's; (b) break the candidate flush siblings sub_821FB340 / sub_8221FA08 / sub_822045E0 in prod — which one fires during the menu render and leads to a DRAW_INDX emit (set a hardware watchpoint on prod's command-buffer write, or break prod's known draw helper); (c) once the flush guest-fn is identified in prod, check whether variant A's full-chain run reaches it (one-shot break in variant A) — if NOT, find its guard; if YES but no PM4 lands, it writes to a buffer REX_FRAMEEXEC doesn't execute. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.99 = measurement only, static analysis; no code change, no new tool).

———— cont.100 — ⭐⭐ PROD-ORACLE: variant A faithfully runs the FULL menu render (BOTH the fill chain AND a 2nd transform-write path sub_822045E0) — IDENTICAL to prod; the render EXECUTES + WRITES geometry. The gap is downstream (where the verts go vs what's fetched) ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change; new tools prod_flush.gdb + va_drawchain.gdb):** prod-oracle by symbol name (cont.99 unblocked it). Broke the render chain + the cont.99 flush candidates BY NAME in prod (renders the menu), then ran the SAME breakpoints in variant A's full chain.

**PROD (prod_flush.gdb):**
- **Fill chain CONFIRMED identical to variant A:** `sub_821F8E60 ← sub_821F8488 ← sub_821FB228 ← sub_8222D808 ← sub_8222E2B0 ← sub_82213150 ← sub_82227450 ← sub_82226AD0 ← sub_82225D50 (×4 recursive scene-graph walk) ← sub_822132A0 ← sub_82167248 ← sub_82150970 (frontend)`.
- **sub_822045E0 FIRES via a SEPARATE chain:** root `sub_82249678 → sub_8214FFD0 → sub_8221ED18 → sub_82213040 → sub_822112C0(×2) → sub_822132A0 → sub_8222A2A0 → sub_8222A0F0 → sub_82229D00 → sub_822296C0 → sub_822045E0`. (sub_821FB340 + sub_8221FA08 did NOT fire → ruled out as the flush.)

**VARIANT A (va_drawchain.gdb, full chain — DECISIVE):**
- **sub_822045E0, sub_822296C0, sub_8222A2A0 ALL FIRE on thread 1**, via the IDENTICAL chain as prod (frame-for-frame: sub_822045E0←sub_822296C0←sub_82229D00←sub_8222A0F0←sub_8222A2A0←sub_822169B8←sub_822132A0←sub_822112C0(×2)←sub_82213040←sub_8221ED18←sub_8214FFD0; only diff = an extra PPCInvokeGuest dispatch frame, vs prod's direct call). ⇒ **variant A faithfully EXECUTES the full menu render — BOTH the fill chain AND the sub_822045E0 draw/transform path.**

**WHAT sub_822045E0 IS (ppc_recomp.22:21819-21997):** a per-quad **transformed-vertex writer** — applies a matrix via `vmaddfp` (vector multiply-add = world×proj transform) to 4 vectors (v8,v9,v13,v0), then writes them via `stvlx`/`stvrx` (unaligned BE vector stores) to **`ea = r3`** (the destination VB; stride r9). So variant A IS computing + writing transformed menu geometry to a buffer.

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS — THE RENDER RUNS; THE GAP IS DOWNSTREAM (re-pins cont.22 with the live title):** the menu render code executes IDENTICALLY in prod and variant A — both the fill chain (sub_821F8E60, accumulate) and the transform-write chain (sub_822045E0, writes transformed quads to r3). So the wall is NOT "the title doesn't render" — it DOES, faithfully. The divergence is purely at the geometry destination / GPU-fetch: **where does sub_822045E0 write (r3), and does the content draw fetch THAT buffer?** This is exactly the cont.22 "vertex-data ADDRESS MISMATCH" (verts → slot 1 / 0xA01FE0FC, draws fetch slot 0 / 0xA2000000, unwritten) — but now LOCALIZED to a concrete writer (sub_822045E0) that runs in BOTH builds and can be instrumented in both for a direct prod-vs-A comparison.

**⭐NEXT (cont.101) — CAPTURE sub_822045E0's DESTINATION (r3) IN BOTH BUILDS:** one-shot capture sub_822045E0's r3 (dest VB) + r9 (stride) + the transformed vert values in variant A AND prod. Compare: (a) variant A's r3 vs the content draw's fetch slot-0 target (0xA2000000, cont.22) and the build-cursor segment REX_FRAMEEXEC executes — if r3 ≠ fetched slot, that's the mismatch, now pinned; (b) prod's r3 (where prod writes → the GPU fetches it) vs variant A's r3 — do they MATCH? if prod writes to the same addr the draw fetches but variant A writes elsewhere, the bug is a variant-A address divergence; if both write to the same addr, the bug is the fetch-constant/draw not pointing there. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.100 = measurement only, new gdb tools prod_flush.gdb + va_drawchain.gdb; no code change).

———— cont.101 — ⚠️SELF-CORRECTION: sub_822045E0 builds a TRANSFORM MATRIX (not vertices) into SYSTEM memory; it is NOT the draw/geometry emit. + prod capture method failed ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change; new tools va_vertdest.gdb + prod_vertdest.gdb + va_vertdest2.gdb):** captured sub_822045E0's destination r3 (not modified entry→store, so r3=dest; r9=16 stride) and the 4 written vectors, in variant A AND prod (one-shot).

**VARIANT A — dest is SYSTEM memory, output is a MATRIX:**
- r3 (dest) = 0x060FC7D8, 0x06102C78, 0x000E51B8 (inside the render-ctx obj 0x000E50F0!), 0x000F9524 — all **SYSTEM/heap memory, NOT the GPU VB range (0xA0xxxxxx) and NOT the cont.22 fetch slot-0 target (0xA2000000)**.
- The 4 written vectors are SPARSE with tiny scale factors: v8=[0,0,0,**0.000566**], v9=[0,0,**0.000959**,0] (one non-zero element each). These are NOT screen-space verts (those are pixel-range x,y) — they're **projection/scale-MATRIX elements** (0.000566≈2/3534, 0.000959≈2/2085 = viewport scale factors).
- ⇒ **sub_822045E0 builds a TRANSFORM MATRIX (vmaddfp = matrix concat) into system memory** — transform SETUP, not the geometry/draw emit.

**⚠️ SELF-CORRECTION of cont.100:** cont.100 labeled sub_822045E0 "a per-quad transformed-vertex writer" and "the draw path." That was WRONG — it's a matrix builder writing to system memory. cont.100's CORE result STANDS (variant A runs the full menu render IDENTICALLY to prod — both chains fire frame-for-frame), but sub_822045E0 is matrix MATH within that render, NOT the vertex/draw emit. The actual GPU-VB vertex emit remains the cont.55 sub_8242BF10 path (→ the dynamic VB 0xA022FFF0), and the geometry gap remains the cont.22 slot-0 (0xA2000000, unwritten) vs slot-1 (0xA01FE0FC, written) FETCH MISMATCH.

**PROD CAPTURE FAILED (method bug):** prod_vertdest.gdb read *(uint32*)rdi as guest r3, but the values decode as FLOATS (0x460B95B8≈8933.0, 0x400334C8≈2.05) → **rdi ≠ &ctx at prod's sub_822045E0 entry** (the -O2 prod build hoists &ctx to a callee-saved reg; rdi is reused). prod_pc.gdb's rdi=&ctx convention holds only at PPCInvokeGuest-dispatched entries, not direct-called optimized leaves. The prod-vs-A address comparison is INVALID this iteration — needs a corrected method (find prod's &ctx register, or break at a PPCInvokeGuest boundary to sub_822045E0).

**⇒ RECALIBRATION:** cont.100-101 explored sub_822045E0 (a transform-matrix side path) — it is NOT the geometry emit. The render-runs-faithfully result (cont.100) is the durable gain. Return to the cont.22/55 vertex gap as the real target, now armed with prod-by-name symbols.

**⭐NEXT (cont.102) — HW-WATCHPOINT THE FETCH SLOT-0 TARGET (0xA2000000) IN PROD vs A (resolve cont.22 directly):** cont.22 HW-confirmed slot-0 (0xA2000000) is NEVER written in variant A (verts go to slot-1 0xA01FE0FC via sub_8242BF10). The decisive prod-oracle: in PROD, (a) read the content draw's fetch-constant slot-0 value (does prod's draw fetch 0xA2000000 or slot-1 0xA01FE0FC?), and (b) HW-watchpoint prod's 0xA2000000-equivalent to catch WHO writes it. If prod's draw fetches slot-1 (not slot-0) → variant A's bug is the FETCH CONSTANT pointing at the wrong (empty) slot-0; if prod writes 0xA2000000 via a fn variant A doesn't run → that writer is the gap. This pins cont.22 (write-dest vs fetch-source) with the prod oracle. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.101 = measurement only, new gdb tools; no code change).

———— cont.102 — ⭐⭐ STRATEGIC REFRAME: prod ≠ variant A RUNTIME. variant A REPLACED prod's rex-engine presenter with the hand-rolled ExecuteType3 PM4-interpreter spike. The wall is variant A's RUNTIME (ExecuteType3 sprite-draw vertex fetch), NOT the guest (faithful) ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change; nm symbol comparison prod vs variant A):** the cont.101 prod-capture failure prompted checking whether prod even shares variant A's runtime. **It does NOT.**
- **variant A (sp_td_varianta) runtime symbols:** ExecuteType3, ExecutePM4, FrameBufDump — a HAND-ROLLED PM4 interpreter with heuristic carving (s_spritecarve, s_skipBackdrop, s_resultscan, drawlog). variant A has NO rex-presenter symbols (no ReXApp::SetupPresentation / ui::Presenter / ImmediateDrawer).
- **prod (south_park_td) runtime symbols:** rex::ui::Presenter, ImGuiDrawer, ImmediateDrawer, rex::ReXApp::SetupPresentation, g_present_count — the REAL rex engine presentation layer. prod has NONE of variant A's ExecuteType3/ExecutePM4/FrameBufDump.
- ⇒ **prod and variant A have DIFFERENT RUNTIMES.** The GUEST code (sub_xxxx, 15123 fns) is shared + identical (cont.100: runs faithfully in both). But variant A REPLACED the rex presenter with the ExecuteType3 PM4-interpreter SPIKE; prod uses the real rex engine. They are two different rendering architectures over the same guest.

**⇒ THE WALL IS RELOCATED — it's variant A's ExecuteType3, precisely:** this reconciles cont.90/96/100/22 into one picture:
1. The guest faithfully emits the menu's PM4 draws (cont.100) — prim 5/13 (sprite/text), prim 8 (backdrop).
2. Those draws reach variant A's **ExecuteType3** (kernel.cpp:1641 PM4_DRAW_INDX), which has heuristic handling: **s_spritecarve (REX_SPRITECARVE) for prim 5/13** at kernel.cpp:1848, **s_skipBackdrop (REX_UITEXT_FIT) for prim 8** at 1814, s_resultscan at 1546.
3. But ExecuteType3's sprite-draw **vertex fetch reads the EMPTY slot-0 (0xA2000000, cont.22)** instead of where the verts actually are → the menu has no visible geometry despite the draws arriving.
⇒ The remaining monumental work is in variant A's RUNTIME (ExecuteType3's sprite-draw vertex fetch / the s_spritecarve heuristic), NOT the guest (faithful, cont.100) and NOT prod (a different architecture). The cont.22 slot-0/slot-1 question is the crux, now firmly a variant-A-runtime issue.

**⇒ PROD-ORACLE'S ROLE CLARIFIED:** prod proves the guest emits correct draws (the menu renders in prod via the rex engine), but prod's rendering implementation (rex presenter) is NOT directly portable to variant A's PM4-interpreter architecture. The prod-oracle's value was confirming guest faithfulness (cont.100) + draw semantics; the IMPLEMENTATION must be completed in variant A's ExecuteType3.

**⭐NEXT (cont.103) — MEASURE whether prim 5/13 sprite draws reach ExecuteType3 + WHERE their verts are:** run variant A full chain with the ExecuteType3 drawlog/REX_SPRITECARVE trace — do prim 5/13 (sprite/text) draws actually arrive at kernel.cpp:1641? For each, what is the fetch slot-0 value + is it written? This is the cont.22 question, now scoped to ExecuteType3: if prim 5/13 draws arrive but fetch the empty slot-0, the fix is ExecuteType3 reading the correct vertex slot (cont.22: verts at slot-1 0xA01FE0FC via sub_8242BF10). If prim 5/13 don't arrive, the content draws aren't reaching the executed segments (the cont.88-90 segment-execution gap). Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.102 = measurement only, nm symbol comparison; no code change).

———— cont.103 — ⭐⭐ DECISIVE: the menu's sprite/text (prim 5/13) draws are COMPLETELY ABSENT from variant A's executed stream — only the backdrop (prim 8) renders. The wall is DRAW-SUBMISSION, not vertex-fetch (cont.22 was a red herring for this) ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change; existing flags REX_DRAWDECODE + REX_DRAWLOG, full chain):** ran variant A (REX_FRAMEEXEC+EWDRAIN+SUBSYS+TIMER + REX_DRAWDECODE=400 REX_DRAWLOG=400) and inventoried EVERY draw that reaches ExecuteType3 (kernel.cpp:1641).

**RESULT — the executed draw inventory at the live menu:**
- **[draw] (numInd>2): 29, ALL prim=8** (init=0x30088, numInd=3 = kRectangleList backdrop), ~1/frame, marching addresses.
- **[drawdec] (no filter): 53 total = 29 RECT-list (prim 8) + 24 point (prim 1, setup, vertexbufs=0).** The backdrop draws #25+ have a REAL vertex fetch: `vertexbufs=1 [vf0 addr=0x9007C sz=84]` (84 B = 3 verts) — so the backdrop fetches real verts and RENDERS.
- **ZERO tri-strip (prim 5), ZERO quad (prim 13), ZERO tri-list (prim 4)** — the menu's sprite/text content draws are COMPLETELY ABSENT from the executed command stream, even unfiltered.
- [frameexec]: 30 calls, each "executed 1 seg", marching 0xA001386C→0xA0090180→0xA009B50C→…→0xA0228C00 (~0x88000/frame). 6 [VdSwap], 13 [swapbuf].

**⇒ DECISIVE — THE WALL IS DRAW-SUBMISSION, NOT VERTEX-FETCH:** variant A's executed command stream contains ONLY the backdrop (prim 8, 1/frame, with real verts) + setup (point) draws. The menu's sprite/text (prim 5/13) draws NEVER reach ExecuteType3. So the cont.22 slot-0/slot-1 vertex-fetch saga + the s_spritecarve heuristic were chasing a RED HERRING for the sprite path — **the sprite/text draws don't even exist in the stream to fetch verts from.** The guest BUILDS them (cont.100: the fill chain runs), but they land in a command buffer / submission that variant A's CP (REX_FRAMEEXEC's segment march) does NOT execute. Only the backdrop's per-frame segment is executed.

**⇒ This reconciles the cascade cleanly:** backdrop (prim 8) → in the executed per-frame segment → renders ✅. Sprite/text (prim 5/13) → built by the guest but submitted to a DIFFERENT buffer (the batched-UI flush, cont.98) that variant A doesn't link into the executed ring/segments → absent ❌. The cont.88-90 "segment-execution gap" is the real wall, now precisely characterized: variant A executes the backdrop segment but not the sprite/text submission.

**⭐NEXT (cont.104) — FIND WHERE THE SPRITE/TEXT DRAWS ARE SUBMITTED (the buffer variant A doesn't execute):** the guest builds prim 5/13 draws (cont.98 batched-UI flush) but they're not in variant A's executed segments. (a) prod-oracle: prod renders them, so find prod's prim 5/13 draw submission — which command buffer / IB they go to, and how it's linked into the ring (an INDIRECT_BUFFER the guest emits). (b) variant A: instrument the ring/segment walk to find if there's an INDIRECT_BUFFER (op 0x3F) or a segment pointing at the sprite/text draws that REX_FRAMEEXEC isn't following. (c) the batched flush (cont.98) emits the sprite DRAW_INDX to a command buffer — find that buffer's address and check if it's in the executed segment range (0xA001xxxx-0xA022xxxx) or elsewhere. Get variant A to execute that buffer. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.103 = measurement only, existing flags; no code change).

———— cont.104 — ⭐⭐ DECISIVE: the sprite/text (prim 5/13) DRAW_INDX packets ARE EMITTED into guest memory (firstSprite@0xA009A588) — the flush DOES run; they're just in a buffer variant A's CP doesn't execute ————

**ONE CHANGE (gated REX_DRAWSCAN) + MEASUREMENT:** added a gated guest-GPU-memory scan (kernel.cpp, after the frameexec block, ~line 3630) that walks 0xA0000000-0xA0600000 for DRAW_INDX (op 0x22) / DRAW_INDX_2 (op 0x36) packets and tallies by prim (prim = init&0x3F; init = op==0x22?data[1]:data[0], data at header+4; sanity-skip numInd==0 or >100000). Capped 4, GpuLock. Default boot UNREGRESSED (flag off → byte-identical; verified: default boot 52916 lines, exit 137/no crash).

**RESULT (full chain + REX_DRAWSCAN):**
- scans #1-3 (early): only **p8(rect)=6** (backdrop) — the sprites aren't emitted yet (title still reaching the menu).
- **scan #4 (at the menu): p5(strip)=2, p13(quad)=1, p8(rect)=11, p4(list)=1 — the sprite/text DRAW_INDX packets DO EXIST in guest memory!** firstSprite@**0xA009A588** init=0x40085 (numInd=4, prim=5 = a quad sprite). + a prim-13 (text quad) + a prim-4 (tri-list).

**⇒ DECISIVE — the flush DOES run; the sprite draws ARE emitted, just NOT executed:** this rules out "the flush doesn't run." The guest builds (cont.100) AND emits (cont.104) the sprite/text DRAW_INDX packets into guest memory. cont.103 showed they're absent from the EXECUTED stream → so they're in a buffer variant A's CP doesn't execute. The first sprite is at **0xA009A588**, which falls in the GAP between executed segments (frameexec #0-2 end at 0xA0090180; #3 starts at 0xA009B50C; 0xA0090180 < 0xA009A588 < 0xA009B50C). So the sprite-draw buffer is a region NOT covered by the build-cursor directory's executed chunks (consistent with the cont.88 note "the rich UI is NOT in device+13568").

**⇒ The wall is now PRECISELY: variant A's CP doesn't execute the command buffer at ~0xA009A588 that holds the emitted sprite/text draws.** Two sub-questions: (1) how is that buffer MEANT to be reached — an INDIRECT_BUFFER (op 0x3F) somewhere pointing at it, or a separate ring/segment? (2) why does the build-cursor directory (dev+13568) not include it?

**⭐NEXT (cont.105) — HOW IS THE 0xA009A588 SPRITE BUFFER REACHED:** extend the scan to (a) report the FULL extent of the sprite draws (first..last sprite addr → the buffer's range), and dump the bytes AROUND 0xA009A588 (the packets before/after — is it a standalone IB with a header? what type-3 packets bracket it?). (b) scan the ring (0xA0002000) + the executed segments for an INDIRECT_BUFFER (op 0x3F) whose target is ~0xA009A588 — if one exists but variant A's ExecutePM4 isn't following it, that's the fix (follow the IB). (c) prod-oracle: prod executes this buffer — find how (the IB/submission linking it). Then make variant A's CP execute the 0xA009A588 region (e.g. ExecutePM4 on it, or follow the IB). Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.104 = gated REX_DRAWSCAN; verified no-crash 52916-line default boot).

———— cont.105 — ⭐⭐⭐ THE FIX PATH FOUND: the sprite draws are linked into the MAIN RING (0xA0002000) via INDIRECT_BUFFER; variant A's REX_FRAMEEXEC executes the build-cursor SEGMENTS (backdrop) instead of the ring (sprites). Execute the ring → sprites render ————

**ONE CHANGE (extended REX_DRAWSCAN) + MEASUREMENT:** extended the cont.104 scan to report the sprite-draw EXTENT, dump the packets BRACKETING the first sprite, and scan for INDIRECT_BUFFER (op 0x3F) packets targeting the sprite region.

**RESULT (full chain + REX_DRAWSCAN):**
- **The sprite draws are REAL PM4 in a proper command buffer.** bracket @0xA009A588: `…C0006000 FFFFFFFF | C0012201 00000000 00040085 | C0006000 80000000 C0015A01 0000001A 00118B89 C0004601…` — the middle `C0012201` is a type-3 DRAW_INDX header (op 0x22, count 1), `00040085` = init (numInd=4, prim=5), bracketed by SET_CONSTANT-type setup packets. A normal command stream with the sprite draw embedded.
- **The sprite buffer is reachable via INDIRECT_BUFFER packets IN THE MAIN RING (0xA0002000):** `IB@0xA00020A0 → 0xA00979A0 len=266`, `IB@0xA000207C → 0xA00975A0 len=11`, `IB@0xA0002088 → 0xA00975E0 len=35`, and later frames march: `→0xA0117A40`, `→0xA011FF80 len=35`, `→0xA0120280 len=266`, `→0xA01A0320`. These IBs are at ring offsets 0x7C/0x88/0xA0… (the CP_RB ring, cont.103 base=0xA0002000). The sprite count grows each scan (#4: 2/1, #5: 3/2, #6: 4/3 prim5/13) as the title builds more frames.
- **ExecutePM4 DOES follow INDIRECT_BUFFER** (kernel.cpp:1571-1576: `ExecutePM4(TranslatePhys(ibAddr), ibLen, depth+1)` — recurses). So the mechanism to reach the sprite draws EXISTS.

**⇒ DECISIVE — THE GAP + THE FIX:** the sprite/text draws are linked into the MAIN RING (0xA0002000) via INDIRECT_BUFFER, and ExecutePM4 can follow IBs. BUT variant A's **REX_FRAMEEXEC executes the build-cursor DIRECTORY segments (dev+13568) — which hold only the backdrop — NOT the main ring**. So the backdrop (in the build-cursor) renders ✅, but the sprites (in the ring's IBs) are never executed ❌. **The fix: execute the MAIN RING (0xA0002000) [RPTR..WPTR] through ExecutePM4 — it will follow the INDIRECT_BUFFERs into the sprite draws → they reach ExecuteType3 → the menu renders.** This is the "real CP" the NIGHT-LOG comments anticipated (execute the ring, not the build-cursor hack).

**⚠️ Caveat for the fix:** the ring is circular (cont.103: WPTR=79, RPTR=73 — RPTR had already advanced past the IBs at dwords 31-40). So a naive [RPTR..WPTR] window may miss IBs already consumed. The fix likely needs to execute the ring as-built (catch the window each frame, or execute a generous [base..WPTR] span), and avoid double-firing side effects (the backdrop already executes via REX_FRAMEEXEC — may need to pick ONE path).

**⭐NEXT (cont.106) — EXECUTE THE MAIN RING (the fix):** add a gated REX_RINGEXEC: at the per-frame sync, ExecutePM4 the main ring (0xA0002000, span up to CP_RB_WPTR) so it follows the INDIRECT_BUFFERs into the sprite draws. MEASURE: do prim 5/13 draws now reach ExecuteType3 (the drawlog/REX_DRAWDECODE shows tri-strip/quad)? Does the menu's sprite/text geometry get carved (s_spritecarve / the esVerts bridge)? Watch for double-execution / side-effect storms (cap, GpuLock, gate). If the circular-ring window is the obstacle, instead execute the specific sprite IBs the scan found (0xA00979A0 etc.) or hook the ring-write to capture IBs as they're submitted. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.105 = gated REX_DRAWSCAN extension; verified no-crash default boot 698 lines/8s).

———— cont.106 — THE FIX ATTEMPT (REX_RINGEXEC) — NEGATIVE but NARROWING: executing the main ring's IBs floods setup/backdrop draws but NOT the sprites; the sprite buffer (0xA009A588) is NOT referenced by the ring's IBs ————

**ONE CHANGE (gated REX_RINGEXEC) + MEASUREMENT:** added REX_RINGEXEC (kernel.cpp, after the drawscan block): at the per-frame sync, scan a generous span of the main ring (0xA0002000, up to CP_RB_WPTR+16) for INDIRECT_BUFFER (op 0x3F) packets and ExecutePM4 each IB target (ExecutePM4 recurses into nested IBs, kernel.cpp:1575). Capped 64 IBs/frame, 60 frames, GpuLock. ALSO discovered variant A ALREADY has a real CP (kernel.cpp:2152-2163): on each WPTR-kick it does ExecuteRing(lastWptr, wptr) (the incremental window) + advances RPTR — so the main ring IS executed incrementally; REX_RINGEXEC re-executes a broader span to catch missed IBs.

**RESULT (full chain + REX_RINGEXEC + REX_DRAWDECODE=20000):**
- REX_RINGEXEC executes **64 IBs/frame** (hits the cap; WPTR climbs 79→721 — far more ring activity than cont.103). It FLOODS ExecuteType3 with many more draws: **1464 point + 869 RECT-list** (vs cont.103's 53 total). So the ring IBs ARE being executed and DO contain draws (setup + backdrop).
- **BUT still ZERO tri-strip (prim 5) / quad (prim 13)** in the [drawdec] — the SPRITE draws STILL don't reach ExecuteType3. REX_DRAWSCAN confirms they remain in memory (p5=5, p13=3 @ 0xA009A588..0xA01ABACC).
- **WHY:** the ring's IBs target **0xA00975A0/0xA00979A0** (len ≤266, max reach 0xA0097DC8) and the marching **0xA0117A40/0xA0120280/0xA01A0320** — **NONE contains the sprite buffer at 0xA009A588** (0xA00979A0+266*4 = 0xA0097DC8 < 0xA009A588). Executing these IBs (which would follow any NESTED IB) does not surface the sprites → the IB at 0xA00979A0 has no nested IB to 0xA009A588 either.

**⇒ THE FIX HYPOTHESIS WAS WRONG (honest negative):** the sprite draws are NOT reachable via the main ring's INDIRECT_BUFFERs. The sprite buffer (0xA009A588) is in a region referenced by NEITHER the executed build-cursor chunks (gap [0xA0090180..0xA009B50C]) NOR the directory segments (0xA04D-0xA056) NOR the main ring's IBs (0xA0097xxx). It's submitted/linked by a YET-UNIDENTIFIED mechanism. cont.105's "sprites in ring IBs" read was imprecise — the ring has IBs NEAR the sprite region but they point at 0xA0097xxx, not the actual sprite at 0xA009Axxx.

**⭐NEXT (cont.107) — FIND WHAT REFERENCES THE SPRITE BUFFER (0xA009A588):** (a) extend the scan to search ALL guest memory (0xA0000000-0xA0600000) for an INDIRECT_BUFFER (op 0x3F) whose [target, target+len*4) CONTAINS 0xA009A588 (not just "near" it) — the actual reference. (b) if none, the sprite buffer is submitted by a NON-IB mechanism: prod-oracle it — in prod (sprites render) HW-watchpoint the READ of 0xA009A588 to catch prod's CP reaching it, or find the kernel submit call. (c) reconsider the cont.98 batched-UI flush: it emits the sprite draws to 0xA009A588 then must SUBMIT that buffer — find the submit (a kernel function / a second ring / a VdSwap-time command) that variant A stubs or doesn't execute. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.106 = gated REX_RINGEXEC; verified no-crash default boot 673 lines/8s).

———— cont.107 — ⭐ the sprite buffer (0xA009A588) is ORPHANED from the GPU command stream: NO IB range contains it, NO raw pointer to it exists in GPU memory. The reference is in system memory OR it's a direct kernel submit ————

**ONE CHANGE (CONTAINS + raw-pointer search in REX_DRAWSCAN) + MEASUREMENT:** replaced cont.105's loose "near" IB check with (a) a precise CONTAINS-search — for every INDIRECT_BUFFER (op 0x3F) in 0xA0000000-0xA0600000, does [target, target+len*4) actually contain 0xA009A588? — and (b) a raw-pointer search — does any dword anywhere == the sprite addr (0xA009A588) or its phys (0x9A588)? Plus a widened bracket dump (-16..+16).

**RESULT (full chain + REX_DRAWSCAN):**
- **NO IB range contains the sprite 0xA009A588** (CONTAINS-search empty across scans #4-6, sprite count growing 2/1→6/3).
- **NO raw pointer to 0xA009A588 / phys 0x9A588 found** (no dword in 0xA0000000-0xA0600000 equals it).
- Widened bracket @0xA009A588[-16..+16]: `…00002102 0 000548BA 1 0 1 0 0011EE83 10000022 | 00025000 0 0 0 C0006000 FFFFFFFF | C0012201 0 00040085 | C0006000 80000000 C0015A01 0000001A 00118B89 C0004601 00000019 80000000×3 000F4000 3F666666…` — the draw (C0012201, op 0x22) sits in a PM4 stream bracketed by SET_CONSTANT-type packets; preceded by a header-ish region (000548BA / 0011EE83 / 10000022 / 00025000) that is NOT a clean IB/segment descriptor. (3F666666 = 0.9f — a draw param.)

**⇒ DECISIVE — the sprite buffer is ORPHANED from the GPU command stream:** neither an INDIRECT_BUFFER nor a raw pointer in GPU memory (0xA0000000-0xA0600000) references 0xA009A588. Combined with cont.106 (not in the ring IBs) + cont.104 (in the gap between executed build-cursor chunks, not in the directory segments): the sprite draws are BUILT into a buffer that nothing in the GPU command stream points at. So the buffer must be referenced from **system memory** (the render-ctx structs at 0x000Exxxx — the cont.98 batched-UI builder holds it) OR submitted via a **direct kernel call** (a command-buffer-submit / VdSwap-time mechanism) that hands the buffer to the GPU without a guest-memory IB. This is exactly the cont.98 "deferred batch flush" — the flush builds the buffer AND submits it via a path variant A doesn't model.

**⭐NEXT (cont.108) — PROD-ORACLE THE SPRITE SUBMIT + scan system memory:** (a) extend the pointer-search into SYSTEM memory (scan e.g. 0x00010000-0x02000000 + the render-ctx region 0x000E0000-0x00120000) for a dword == 0xA009A588 / phys 0x9A588 — the system-side reference the batched-UI builder holds. (b) PROD-ORACLE (mandated): in prod (sprites render), HW-watchpoint the READ of the sprite-buffer-equivalent address to catch prod's CP/submit reaching it — bt → the guest function that SUBMITS the sprite buffer. That submit fn is the same guest fn in variant A (cont.100 faithful); find it + check whether variant A runs it / where its output goes. (c) the cont.98 flush: trace from the batched-UI flush forward to the buffer-submit call. The fix: make variant A execute the sprite buffer via whatever path prod uses. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.107 = gated REX_DRAWSCAN extension; verified no-crash default boot 679 lines/8s).

———— cont.108 — ⭐⭐ FOUND THE REFERENCE: the sprite buffer IS referenced — by the DEVICE BUILD-CURSOR DIRECTORY in SYSTEM memory (device+13416..13652). REX_FRAMEEXEC executes only the current chunk [dev+13568,13572]; the sprite's directory entry is one it SKIPS ————

**ONE CHANGE (system-memory pointer scan in REX_DRAWSCAN) + MEASUREMENT:** cont.107 found the sprite buffer orphaned in GPU memory; extended the pointer-search into SYSTEM memory (0x00010000-0x01000000, once) for a dword whose gpuForm (0xA0000000|(v&0x1FFFFFFF)) lands within ±0x4000 of the sprite.

**RESULT — the sprite buffer IS referenced (in system memory):** a CLUSTER of pointers at **0x2A3E8-0x2A4D4 = device+13416..device+13652** (device@0x26F80) bracketing the sprite buffer:
- dev+13416=0xA009B4E0, dev+13572=**0xA009B50C** (= frameexec #3's start!), dev+13580=0xA009B518, dev+13616=**0xA0097DDC** (just past the ring IB 0xA00979A0+266*4=0xA0097DC8), dev+13624=0xA0097DE0, dev+13652=**0xA009A9D0** (= the cont.97 Unlock target dev+13652; just past the sprite end 0xA009A9AC).
- Plus scattered heap pointers (0x36140=0xA009DF20, 0x37A40=0xA009B1FA, 0x3ABD4=0xA0097A9D, …).

**⇒ DECISIVE REFINEMENT of cont.107 — NOT orphaned; referenced by the SYSTEM-MEMORY device build-cursor directory:** cont.107 only scanned GPU memory. The sprite buffer is referenced by the **device build-cursor DIRECTORY** (device+13400..13700 — the cont.104 devdump region, records {base, writeptr, 0x1080, base+0x44, 0, device}). The directory entries near the sprite (bases 0xA0097DDC / writeptrs 0xA009A9D0 etc.) describe the segment CONTAINING the sprite (0xA009A588 ∈ [0xA0097DDC..0xA009A9D0]). **REX_FRAMEEXEC reads ONLY the current chunk [dev+13568, dev+13572] = [~0xA009B50C..] and walks THAT for 0x81 descriptors — so it executes the LATEST segment (backdrop) but NOT the earlier directory entry holding the sprite.** The sprite at 0xA009A588 falls in the gap [0xA0090180..0xA009B50C] precisely because that's a PRIOR directory entry, not the current chunk.

**⇒ THE FIX (refined): execute the FULL device build-cursor directory, not just the current [dev+13568, dev+13572] chunk.** The directory (device+13400+) lists ALL segment records {base, writeptr}; the sprite's segment is one of them. Walk every record, ExecutePM4(base, writeptr-base) — the sprite segment then reaches ExecuteType3.

**⭐NEXT (cont.109) — PARSE THE FULL DIRECTORY + EXECUTE THE SPRITE'S SEGMENT:** dump device+13400..13700 to parse the segment records (cont.104 fmt {base, writeptr, 0x1080, base+0x44, 0, dev}); identify the record whose [base, writeptr] CONTAINS 0xA009A588 (base near 0xA0097DDC, writeptr near 0xA009A9D0). Add a gated REX_DIREXEC: walk ALL directory records and ExecutePM4(base, (writeptr-base)/4) for each (or just the sprite's), at the per-frame sync. MEASURE: do prim 5/13 now reach ExecuteType3 (REX_DRAWDECODE shows tri-strip/quad)? Does the menu sprite/text geometry carve (s_spritecarve/esVerts)? Watch double-exec (the current chunk is already done by REX_FRAMEEXEC — skip it or dedup). Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.108 = gated REX_DRAWSCAN sys-scan; verified no-crash default boot 686 lines/8s).

———— cont.109 — 🎉🎉 BREAKTHROUGH (THE FIX WORKS): REX_DIREXEC (execute the FULL device directory) makes the menu SPRITE/TEXT draws (prim 5/13) REACH ExecuteType3 WITH REAL VERTEX FETCHES (vf95). After ~13 iterations, the menu geometry flows to the renderer ————

**ONE CHANGE (gated REX_DIREXEC) + MEASUREMENT:** added REX_DIREXEC (kernel.cpp, after the ringexec block): at the per-frame sync, scan the device build-cursor DIRECTORY (device+13400..13700) for command-segment addrs (GPU addrs in [0xA0090000, 0xA0120000], the sprite region), sort them, and ExecutePM4 each [addr[i], addr[i+1]) segment — executing the FULL directory's segments, not just REX_FRAMEEXEC's current chunk [dev+13568, dev+13572]. Gated, capped 60 frames, GpuLock.

**RESULT — 🎉 THE SPRITE/TEXT DRAWS NOW REACH ExecuteType3 WITH REAL VERTS:**
- REX_DIREXEC executed **15-21 dir segments/frame** in the early frames (#1-4: 15,15,15,21 segs from n=22-29 cmd-addrs in the directory) — the directory entries REX_FRAMEEXEC was skipping.
- **[drawdec] NOW shows the sprites: 3 tri-strip (prim 5), 2 quad (prim 13), 2 tri-list (prim 4)** — 7 sprite/text draws total reaching ExecuteType3 (vs cont.103/106's ZERO). Each with a **REAL vertex fetch**:
  - `tri-strip numInd=4 init=0x40085 vertexbufs=1 [vf95 addr=0x11EE80 sz=32]` (a sprite quad, 4 verts)
  - `tri-list numInd=6 init=0x60084 [vf95 addr=0x11EEA0 sz=48]`
  - `tri-strip numInd=4 [vf95 addr=0x11EED0 sz=32]`
  - **`quad numInd=252 init=0xFC008D [vf95 addr=0x11EEF0 sz=4032]`** ← SUBSTANTIAL text/menu content (252 indices, 4032 B of verts)
- Far less flooding than REX_RINGEXEC (33 RECT + 24 point, vs RINGEXEC's 869 RECT) — REX_DIREXEC is TARGETED (only the sprite-region directory segments).

**⇒ TWO MAJOR FINDINGS:**
1. **THE FIX WORKS:** executing the FULL device directory (not just the current chunk) is the correct CP behavior — it surfaces the menu sprite/text draws that REX_FRAMEEXEC's single-chunk window was skipping. This is the cont.88-90 "segment-execution gap" SOLVED for the sprites.
2. **The cont.22 "slot-0 empty" was a RED HERRING for the sprites:** the sprite/text draws fetch **slot 95** (vf95, addr 0x11EE80 → 0xA011EE80, with REAL data sz=32-4032) — NOT slot 0 (0xA2000000). cont.22/55's whole slot-0/slot-1 vertex saga + the s_spritecarve heuristic (which reads slot-1 0xA01FE0FC) were aimed at the wrong slot; the real sprite verts are in slot 95, and they're PRESENT.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (REX_DIREXEC gated off; verified 675-line no-crash default boot).

**⭐NEXT (cont.110) — MAKE THE SPRITES VISIBLE (carve via the REAL fetch slot):** the sprite draws now reach ExecuteType3 with real verts in slot 95, but ExecuteType3's s_spritecarve (kernel.cpp:1848) reads the HEURISTIC slot-1 (0xA01FE0FC) — WRONG. Update the sprite carve to read the draw's ACTUAL kVertex fetch slot (the REX_DRAWDECODE scan already finds it = vf95) → the sprite/text geometry carves into the esVerts Vulkan bridge correctly → the menu RENDERS. Then: (a) vulkan_render capture to SEE the menu; (b) decode the vf95 vert format (stride 8 = float2 screen coords? the numInd=252 quad = a text run); (c) consider folding REX_DIREXEC into the default render path (it's the real directory-execution fix). Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.109 = gated REX_DIREXEC; verified no-crash default boot 675 lines/8s).

———— cont.110 — carve WIRED into the render path (REX_EXECSEGS) + reads the real fetch slot — but the EXECSEGS (VdSwap) execution reads STALE/garbage verts; the correct verts are at the FENCE-WAIT (cont.109). PARTIAL ————

**ONE CHANGE (two parts) + MEASUREMENT:** (a) rewrote s_spritecarve (kernel.cpp:1848) to read the draw's ACTUAL kVertex fetch slot (scan the fetch region for the first type-3 slot; stride = vbBytes/numInd) instead of the cont.22 heuristic slot-1 (0xA01FE0FC) + log the verts. (b) added the cont.109 directory-execution into the **REX_EXECSEGS path** (kernel.cpp:4224, under `tl_execsegs=true`) — because the carve blocks (1814/1848) are INSIDE `if (tl_execsegs)`, and tl_execsegs is set ONLY in the REX_EXECSEGS path (VdSwap thread, where tl_esVerts is cleared + submitted to the Vulkan bridge), NOT in REX_FRAMEEXEC/REX_DIREXEC at the fence-wait.

**RESULT — the carve FIRES but reads GARBAGE:**
- With REX_EXECSEGS=3 + REX_DIREXEC + REX_SPRITECARVE the **[spritecarve] log fires** (the carve infra is wired) — but reads WRONG fetch slots: gv=0xA03624FC / 0xA018A244 / 0xA01FE0FC (the old slot-1!), absurd strides (2753860, 43692), and **v0=v1=v2=(0,0)** (zero verts).
- **Sanity: the FENCE-WAIT path (cont.109: REX_FRAMEEXEC+REX_DIREXEC+REX_DRAWDECODE) STILL reads vf95 CORRECTLY** (tri-strip vf95 addr=0x11EE80 sz=32; quad numInd=252 vf95 addr=0x11EEF0 sz=4032). So the sprite draws have the CORRECT fetch slot (95) at the FENCE-WAIT, but the REX_EXECSEGS execution at VdSwap reads a STALE/garbage fetch state for the same draws.

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS — the carve location and the correct-vert timing are AT ODDS:** the carve needs `tl_execsegs` + the esVerts submit, which live in the REX_EXECSEGS (VdSwap) path. But the sprite draws' fetch constants are correct only at the FENCE-WAIT (where cont.109's drawdec read vf95); re-executing the directory at VdSwap reads stale/zero verts (the buffers/constants differ at VdSwap, or my address-SORTED directory exec applies SET_CONSTANTs out of submission order). My "first type-3 slot" scan compounds it (it finds stale type-3 slots, not the draw's slot 95). The backdrop (prim 8) carves fine in REX_EXECSEGS because it's in the in-order [base,wptr] chunk; the sprites (in a prior directory entry, executed out of order) don't.

**⭐NEXT (cont.111) — RECONCILE: carve the sprites where their verts are CORRECT (the fence-wait):** options — (a) run REX_DRAWDECODE + the carve in the SAME REX_EXECSEGS run to confirm drawdec ALSO sees garbage there (isolates location vs my scan); (b) execute the directory in SUBMISSION order (the directory record order, NOT address-sorted) so SET_CONSTANTs apply correctly at each DRAW_INDX; (c) set `tl_execsegs=true` around the FENCE-WAIT REX_FRAMEEXEC+REX_DIREXEC (where verts are correct) and resolve the esVerts submit (the fence-wait may be the SAME thread as VdSwap — if so, accumulate tl_esVerts there and DON'T clear it in REX_EXECSEGS); (d) replace the "first type-3 slot" scan with the VS-microcode vfetch slot (tl_vsUcode, captured at kernel.cpp:1963) to read the draw's ACTUAL slot. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.110 = gated REX_SPRITECARVE/REX_DIREXEC; verified no-crash default boot 685 lines/8s).

———— cont.111 — 🎉 THE CARVE NOW READS REAL SPRITE/TEXT VERTS: fixed the fetch-slot scan (take the LAST type-3 slot = vf95, not the first/stale). The menu's panels + TEXT GLYPHS carve into the esVerts bridge in correct 1768×1043 authoring coords ————

**ONE CHANGE (1-line carve fix) + MEASUREMENT:** cont.110's carve read garbage. DIAGNOSTIC: ran REX_DRAWDECODE (the PROVEN scan) + REX_SPRITECARVE in the SAME REX_EXECSEGS run — drawdec read **vf95 correctly** for the same draws my carve read garbage for. So the bug was MY SCAN, not the location/timing. drawdec reports `vertexbufs=1` (only slot 95 is the draw's kVertex), but my carve `break`'d on the FIRST type-3 slot — a STALE earlier slot (gv=0xA03624FC). **FIX: take the LAST type-3 slot (remove the `break`)** — slot 95 is the highest/real one.

**RESULT — 🎉 THE CARVE READS REAL VERTS:**
- `prim=5 numI=4 gv=0xA011EE80 stride=8 v0=(0,0) v1=(1768,0) v2=(1768,1043)` — a **FULL-SCREEN QUAD** (panel) in **1768×1043 UI-authoring coords** (the cont.22-known authoring resolution!).
- `prim=13 numI=252 gv=0xA011EEF0 stride=16 v0=(16.5,-0.5) v1=(36.5,-0.5) v2=(36.5,38.5)` — **TEXT GLYPHS** (small ~20×39px quads, 252 verts = a text run).
- Multiple sprite/text draws carved: prim-5 panels at 0xA011EE80/0xA011EED0/0xA022FF80/0xA01A7700/0xA02B8800, prim-13 text runs at 0xA011EEF0/0xA022FFF0/0xA01A7750.
- The existing transform `cx=v/884-1, cy=v/521.5-1` (884=1768/2, 521.5=1043/2) maps these authoring coords to clip space EXACTLY → (0,0)→(-1,-1), (1768,1043)→(1,1). So the carved geometry IS correct clip-space geometry, accumulated into tl_esVerts → submitted to the Vulkan bridge.

**⇒ THE SPRITE/TEXT GEOMETRY NOW FLOWS TO THE RENDERER CORRECTLY:** combining cont.109 (REX_DIREXEC surfaces the sprite draws) + cont.110 (carve wired into the REX_EXECSEGS/tl_execsegs path) + cont.111 (carve reads the REAL vf95 verts), the menu's panels + text glyphs are now read in authoring coords, transformed to clip space, and submitted to the render bridge. The whole cont.96-111 arc — "menu doesn't render" → faithful guest render → sprites absent → sprites in the device directory → execute the full directory → read the real fetch slot — has produced the menu geometry at the renderer.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (all gated REX_DIREXEC/REX_EXECSEGS/REX_SPRITECARVE; verified 680-line no-crash default boot).

**⭐NEXT (cont.112) — VISUAL VERIFICATION + game-accurate positions:** the geometry is correct in the carve; now CONFIRM it renders (the prompt's goal: "живое композированное меню в game-accurate позициях"). (a) vulkan_render / a frame capture (screenshot) to SEE the menu panels + text; (b) verify the positions match the game (the 1768×1043 authoring → 1280×720 screen mapping — is 884/521.5 the right divisor, or should it be the real per-draw $worldviewProj?); (c) the prim-13 text needs per-glyph TEXTURING (the font atlas) to be legible — the verts are the glyph quads, the texture is the font; (d) fold REX_DIREXEC+REX_EXECSEGS+REX_SPRITECARVE into a clean default render path (they're the real fix: execute the full device directory + carve from the real fetch slot). Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.111 = gated; verified no-crash default boot 680 lines/8s).

———— cont.112 — 🎉 THE MENU GEOMETRY REACHES THE GPU + IS DRAWN (submitted to the render bridge, thousands of verts, menu pipeline) — but the screenshot capture is unreliable/blank; visual confirmation pending ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change — frame capture + render-code read):** ran the full carve chain under the Vulkan renderer (`DISPLAY=:0 REX_RENDER=1 REX_EXECSEGS=3 REX_DIREXEC=1 REX_SPRITECARVE=1 REX_RENDER_SHOT=N`) to SEE the menu.

**RESULT — 🎉 THE GEOMETRY REACHES THE GPU AND IS DRAWN:**
- The Vulkan renderer initialises (AMD Radeon RADV POLARIS11, swapchain 1280×720, window + Vulkan up).
- **`[render] GPU-build: menu geometry submitted (N verts)`** fires — N grows as the menu loads: 804 → 414/frame early, then **2898 → 3804 → 6156 → 4212 verts** at the full menu. So the carved sprite/text esVerts (cont.111) ARE submitted to the render bridge (SubmitMenuGeometry → g_menuGeom) and the menu pipeline draws them: vulkan_render.cpp:966 binds g_menuPipe, **identity MVP** (verts already clip-space), per-quad palette colors (alpha 0.55), vkCmdDraw per 6-vert quad. **The cont.96-111 pipeline is END-TO-END: guest render → device directory → ExecuteType3 → carve (real vf95 verts) → esVerts → render bridge → GPU draw.**

**BUT the screenshot capture is blank/unreliable:** `/tmp/varianta_shot.ppm` (REX_RENDER_SHOT=150/600) is a UNIFORM (15,15,15) — which is NOT even the render-pass clear color (0.06,0.06,0.10 = 15,15,**26**), so the captured image is a DIFFERENT image than the menu draws to (a capture-path/sync mismatch), not a blended menu frame (alpha-0.55 palette over the clear would be clearly colored). The capture trigger is finicky (exact g_frame match racing the menu load + a video-path vs menu-path present interaction; the "richer"-frame auto-capture also got a blank). So VISUAL confirmation is still pending — the geometry is provably drawn (the submit + draw calls execute), but the capture doesn't show it.

**⇒ STATUS:** the geometry side of the A↔B wall is SOLVED end-to-end (the menu's panels + text reach the GPU as real clip-space geometry and are drawn). What remains is (1) a robust frame capture to SEE it, and (2) the polish — game-accurate positions, per-glyph text texturing, and folding the gated flags into the default path.

**⭐NEXT (cont.113) — ROBUST CAPTURE + VISUAL CONFIRM:** fix the capture to reliably grab a menu frame: (a) understand the (15,15,15) blank — is PresentOnce's menu draw (vulkan_render.cpp:966, gated on subVerts>0) actually in the SAME present + framebuffer the capture (1067/1146) reads, or is the render thread in the VIDEO-present path (the log "video buf=-1/0") that never draws g_menuGeom? (b) make the capture unconditional-on-richest (dump the framebuffer whenever subVerts exceeds a threshold, overwriting) so it can't miss the menu frame; (c) check the g_menuGeomVerts race (CP-thread submit vs render-thread read) — ensure the captured present has subVerts>0. Once a non-blank capture shows the panels+text, verify game-accurate positions (884/521.5 divisor) + add per-glyph texturing. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.112 = measurement only, frame capture; no code change — binary is cont.111's, verified 680-line no-crash default boot).

———— cont.113 — 🎉🎉🎉 VISUAL CONFIRMATION: the menu geometry RENDERS. The cont.112 blank was just the missing REX_MENUTEST flag (the present path that draws g_menuGeom). Captured the first rendered menu frame ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (no code change — flag combo + frame capture + view):** cont.112 found the geometry submitted+drawn but the capture blank. ROOT CAUSE: PresentOnce has TWO paths — path 1 (vulkan_render.cpp:903 `if (g_menutest && g_menuPipe ...)`: render-pass + menu draw of g_menuGeom + capture→/tmp/varianta_menu.ppm) and path 2 (the video/clear fallback + capture→/tmp/varianta_shot.ppm). Without REX_MENUTEST the render thread runs PATH 2 (video) — which never draws the menu and captured a near-black post-movie video frame (the 15,15,15). **FIX: add REX_MENUTEST** (enables path 1, which draws the submitted menu geometry).

**RESULT — 🎉 THE MENU GEOMETRY RENDERS (captured /tmp/varianta_menu.ppm, frame 615, 1280×720):**
- **75 distinct colors** (vs cont.112's 1), 230k non-clear pixels, bbox spanning the whole screen — NON-BLANK, real rendered content.
- The image shows: **full-screen palette panels** (the prim-5 quads rendered as large alpha-blended triangular regions, debug palette colors cyan/orange/green/blue per the cont quad palette) + **a row of small text-glyph rectangles at the top-left** (the prim-13 252-vert text runs — the menu TEXT, as colored quads) with a thin diagonal line.
- ⇒ **THE FULL cont.96-113 PIPELINE IS VISUALLY CONFIRMED END-TO-END:** guest render → device directory (cont.109 REX_DIREXEC) → ExecuteType3 → carve from the real vf95 fetch slot (cont.111) → esVerts → render bridge (cont.110) → menu pipeline draw (cont.112) → **VISIBLE on the framebuffer (cont.113)**. The menu's panels + text geometry render. Sent the frame to the user (the first visually-confirmed variant-A menu render).

**⇒ STATUS — the geometry side of the A↔B wall is SOLVED + VISUALLY CONFIRMED.** What remains is POLISH toward "game-accurate positions": (1) the prim-5 "full-screen quads" dominate the image — determine if they're real menu panels, a background fill, or an over-inclusive carve (they may be a background/clear element, or need their real per-draw transform vs my full-screen 884/521.5); (2) the prim-13 TEXT renders as colored rects but needs per-glyph TEXTURING (the font atlas) to be legible letters; (3) replace the debug palette with the real colors/textures; (4) verify the y-orientation (text is top-left; clip-space y may need flipping for game-accurate placement).

**⭐NEXT (cont.114) — TOWARD GAME-ACCURATE: texture the text + understand the panels:** (a) the prim-13 text glyphs — bind the font atlas texture (the glyphs' UVs are likely in the vf95 verts beyond xy, stride 16 = float4 = xy+uv) and draw textured so the menu text is LEGIBLE; (b) the prim-5 full-screen quads — RE what they are (a backdrop? a panel? trace their fetch + the real $worldviewProj from reg 0x4000 ALU consts); (c) tune the authoring→screen transform for game-accurate positions; (d) once it looks right, fold REX_DIREXEC+REX_EXECSEGS+REX_SPRITECARVE+REX_MENUTEST into a clean default render path. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.113 = measurement only, flag combo + capture; no code change — binary is cont.111's).

———— cont.114 — ⭐ the menu TEXT glyphs are TEXTURED quads: pos.xy + UV.zw (font-atlas coords). Confirmed the text is a horizontal glyph string with UVs → render it with the font atlas for legible text ————

**ONE CHANGE (gated [textvert] log) + MEASUREMENT:** the cont.111 carve reads the text verts as stride-16 (float4). Added a [textvert] dump of the FULL float4 (xy + zw) for the prim-13 text draws to see if zw is the UV.

**RESULT — 🎉 THE TEXT GLYPHS CARRY UVs (textured quads):** each glyph = a 4-vert quad with **pos.xy + UV.zw**:
- glyph 1: pos `(16.5,-0.5)→(36.5,-0.5)→(36.5,38.5)→(16.5,38.5)` (a 20×39px quad), UV `(0.199,0.008)→(0.277,0.008)→(0.277,0.160)→(0.199,0.160)`.
- glyph 2: pos `(35.5,-0.5)→(49.5,-0.5)…` (advances in x), UV `(0.324,0.008)→(0.379,0.008)…`.
- The UVs are in **[0,1]** = normalized FONT-ATLAS coordinates. The positions ADVANCE in x (16.5→35.5→…) = a horizontal text string. So the prim-13 "text" is exactly that — a run of glyph quads, each sampling its letter from the font atlas. (252 verts / 4 = ~63 glyphs, or 252/6-as-tris.)

**⇒ THE TEXT IS TEXTURED GEOMETRY — to make the menu LEGIBLE: bind the font atlas + draw the glyphs with their UVs.** The cont.113 render showed the text as flat colored rects (the carve dropped the UVs + used the flat-color menu pipeline); with the UVs + the font atlas through the textured pipeline (g_texPipe, which already exists for the backdrop), the glyphs become real letters. This is the path to game-accurate text.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (the [textvert] log is gated behind REX_SPRITECARVE; verified 682-line no-crash default boot).

**⭐NEXT (cont.115) — TEXTURE THE MENU TEXT (legible letters):** (a) FIND the font atlas — the prim-13 draw's bound texture (trace the 0x4800 fetch consts' texture slot / the cont.24/54 SetTexture chain at the draw, or REX_DRAWLOG's "tex slot" dump); (b) carve the text glyphs WITH their UVs (pos.xy→clip + uv.zw) into a textured esVerts buffer (like tl_esTexVerts for the backdrop), and draw them via the textured pipeline (g_texPipe: pos+uv + sampler2D, already wired) bound to the font atlas; (c) capture → the menu text should read as letters. Also (parallel): the prim-5 full-screen panels — RE whether they're a backdrop (render dark/subtle) or real panels. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.114 = gated [textvert] log; verified no-crash default boot 682 lines/8s).

———— cont.115 — ⭐ FOUND THE FONT ATLAS: the menu text binds a 256×256 FMT_8 (8bpp alpha glyph mask) texture @ GPU 0xA337D000. Now have the full recipe to texture the menu text ————

**ONE CHANGE (relaxed the [draw] texture-slot dump) + MEASUREMENT:** cont.114 confirmed the text glyphs carry UVs (font-atlas coords). To find the atlas, ran REX_DRAWLOG (which dumps each draw's bound texture fetch consts) — but its filter required `baseAddr >= 0xA0000000` and the title's textures are LOW-PHYS (like the vf95 verts @ 0x11EE80). Relaxed it to dump type-2 (texture) fetch consts with any non-zero base, mapping low-phys → the 0xA0 aperture.

**RESULT — 🎉 THE FONT ATLAS IS FOUND:** the prim-13 text draws (init=0xFC008D, numInd=252) bind:
- **tex slot0: base=0x337D000 (GPU 0xA337D000), 256×256, fmt=2, tiled=0, type=2.**
- **fmt=2 = FMT_8** (rex_texture.h:33) — an 8-bit SINGLE-CHANNEL texture = a font glyph ALPHA MASK (the 8-bit value = glyph coverage). 256×256, untiled.
- ⇒ The complete recipe: the glyph quads (cont.114: pos.xy + UV.zw, UVs in [0,1]) sample this 256×256 FMT_8 atlas at 0xA337D000; the alpha is the letter shape.

**⇒ EVERYTHING NEEDED TO TEXTURE THE MENU TEXT IS NOW KNOWN:** font atlas (256×256 FMT_8 @ 0xA337D000, untiled) + glyph quads with UVs. Render: decode FMT_8 → upload as a Vulkan texture → carve the glyphs with UVs into a textured buffer → draw via the textured pipeline (g_texPipe), sampling the atlas alpha as the glyph coverage, tinted by the text color → LEGIBLE menu text.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (the [draw] texture-slot dump is gated behind REX_DRAWLOG; verified 681-line no-crash default boot).

**⭐NEXT (cont.116) — TEXTURE THE TEXT (the implementation):** (a) add a FMT_8 decode path to rex_texture.h (8bpp → RGBA: R=G=B=255, A=the 8-bit value — or R=G=B=value for a luminance font) if not already present; (b) decode the 256×256 atlas @ 0xA337D000 + upload it as a Vulkan texture (a dedicated font sampler, separate from the backdrop's g_tex); (c) in the carve, route the prim-13 glyphs into a TEXTURED esVerts buffer (pos.xy→clip + uv.zw, like tl_esTexVerts) instead of the flat-color tl_esVerts; (d) in PresentOnce, draw the text via g_texPipe bound to the font atlas (the glyph alpha masks the letters, text color tints); (e) capture → the menu text reads as real letters. Gate behind a flag (e.g. REX_TEXTGLYPH). Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.115 = gated [draw] tex-slot dump; verified no-crash default boot 681 lines/8s).

———— cont.116 — 🎉🎉 THE FONT ATLAS DECODES TO LEGIBLE LETTERS: dumped the 256×256 FMT_8 atlas @ 0xA337D000 → readable glyphs "_This col / ntruedam / fpg". The FMT_8 decode + atlas + UV plan are all confirmed; the textured-text path is de-risked ————

**ONE CHANGE (gated REX_FONTDUMP) + MEASUREMENT:** before wiring the substantial textured-draw (Vulkan), de-risk by verifying the FMT_8 decode. Added REX_FONTDUMP (kernel.cpp, after the direxec block): decode the 256×256 FMT_8 (8bpp, untiled) font atlas @ GPU 0xA337D000 → a grayscale PPM. (GLD32 is BE-swapped, so the raw byte at linear offset i = `(GLD32(base+(i&~3)) >> (8*(3-(i&3)))) & 0xFF`.) Fires once on a late sync (after the menu loads).

**RESULT — 🎉 THE ATLAS IS REAL FONT GLYPHS:** /tmp/varianta_font.ppm (256×256) is mostly black (96%) with 2605 non-black pixels = the glyphs. Viewing it: **clearly legible LETTERS — "_This col" / "ntruedam" / "fpg"** (3 rows of a dynamic glyph cache — only the glyphs the current menu text needs are uploaded). So:
- the **FMT_8 decode WORKS** (atlas → readable letters);
- the atlas at **0xA337D000 is the menu's font glyph cache** (the actual menu text, e.g. "This col[lection]…");
- the cont.114 glyph UVs sample these glyphs.
Sent the decoded atlas to the user (it shows the menu's real text + confirms the decode).

**⇒ THE TEXTURED-TEXT PATH IS FULLY DE-RISKED:** font atlas (256×256 FMT_8 @ 0xA337D000, decodes to legible glyphs) + glyph quads (pos.xy + UV.zw, cont.114) + the textured pipeline (g_texPipe, already wired). Wiring the textured draw will turn the cont.113 colored-rect text into legible letters.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED** (REX_FONTDUMP gated; verified 679-line no-crash default boot).

**⭐NEXT (cont.117) — WIRE THE TEXTURED TEXT DRAW:** (a) add an FMT_8 decode path to the Vulkan texture upload (8bpp → RGBA: A=value, RGB=1, so the alpha masks the glyph and the text color tints) — or reuse rex_texture.h's decode + an R8/RGBA upload; (b) decode + upload the 256×256 atlas @ 0xA337D000 as a dedicated Vulkan font texture (g_fontTex + sampler + descriptor); (c) in the carve, route the prim-13 glyphs into a textured esVerts buffer (pos.xy→clip + uv.zw); (d) in PresentOnce, draw the text via g_texPipe bound to the font atlas; (e) capture → legible menu text. Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.116 = gated REX_FONTDUMP; verified no-crash default boot 679 lines/8s).

———— cont.117 — ⭐ THE TEXTURED-TEXT PIPELINE IS WIRED END-TO-END: the font atlas uploads + the glyph UVs carve + the textured draw fires + the text renders (visible). Not yet legible (all text collapses to one band — the per-draw position is missing) ————

**ONE CHANGE (3-part textured-text wiring) + MEASUREMENT:**
- **kernel.cpp carve:** when REX_TEXTGLYPH, route the prim-13 glyphs into the TEXTURED buffer tl_esTexVerts (pos.xy→clip + uv.zw, the font-atlas UVs) instead of the flat-color tl_esVerts; skip the prim-5 panels in this view (they'd obscure the text). The EXECSEGS path already submits tl_esTexVerts via SubmitTexturedGeometry (line 4294).
- **vulkan_render.cpp:** added LoadFontAtlasOnce — decode the FMT_8 256×256 atlas from guest memory (g_base + phys 0x337D000) → RGBA (white, alpha = the 8-bit glyph coverage) → UploadTexture into g_tex; deferred (the atlas is empty at init, loaded once the menu submits text glyphs); skip the bg .png load when REX_TEXTGLYPH so g_tex holds the font.

**RESULT — 🎉 THE TEXTURED TEXT RENDERS (pipeline wired end-to-end):** run with REX_RENDER+REX_MENUTEST+REX_MENUTEX+REX_TEXTGLYPH+the carve chain:
- logs: `[render] disk-resource: textured geometry submitted (780/402 verts)` + **`[render] font atlas uploaded (256x256 FMT_8 @ guest 0x337D000)`** — the font atlas uploads + the text geometry draws.
- the capture (with the obscuring panels skipped) jumps from 3 → **17 distinct colors** with a visible text band top-left — the textured text IS drawing through g_texPipe sampling the font atlas. (With panels ON, they drew OVER the text — line 957 textured "under the UI", line 966 flat panels after; skipping the prim-5 panels reveals the text.)
- BUT not yet LEGIBLE: the text renders as a thin distorted band/fan top-left, not laid-out readable lines.

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS — the per-draw POSITION is missing:** my carve applies a FIXED authoring→clip transform (cx=v/884-1, cy=v/521.5-1) to every text draw. But each prim-13 draw is a DIFFERENT menu text item at a DIFFERENT screen position — the verts (16.5,-0.5)… are likely LOCAL/relative coords + a per-draw $worldviewProj (the cont.85-86 reg-0x4000 ALU consts Tx/Ty/Px/Py). With the fixed transform, ALL text items collapse to the same top-left band → the distorted fan. The fix is to apply each draw's REAL transform.

**⭐NEXT (cont.118) — LEGIBLE TEXT (apply the per-draw transform):** read each prim-13 draw's per-draw transform from reg 0x4000 (the cont.85-86 [fwxform]: World+Proj — Tx=alu[3] Ty=alu[7] Px=alu[16] Pxw=alu[19] Py=alu[21] Pyw=alu[23]) and apply it to the glyph positions (pos→world→clip) instead of the fixed 884/521.5, so each text item lands at its game-accurate screen position → legible menu lines. Verify the UV orientation (the glyphs should be upright). Then the prim-5 panels (RE: backdrop vs panels) + fold the flags into a default path. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.117 = gated REX_TEXTGLYPH; verified no-crash default boot 675 lines/8s).

———— cont.118 — ⚠️NEGATIVE (reverted): the reg-0x4000 per-draw transform is IDENTICAL for every text draw (a GLOBAL UI xform, not per-item) — NOT the fix for legible text. The distortion is the SAME text re-rendered from multiple buffers, not a missing per-item position ————

**MEASUREMENT (per-draw transform RE) + EXPERIMENTS (reverted):** cont.117 diagnosed the text as collapsed to one band, hypothesizing each prim-13 draw needs its per-draw $worldviewProj. Read the reg-0x4000 transform (cont.85-86 layout: Tx=rg(0,3) Ty=rg(1,3) Px=rg(4,0) Pxw=rg(4,3) Py=rg(5,1) Pyw=rg(5,3)) at the text draws and applied it.

**RESULT — the hypothesis was WRONG:**
- The per-draw transform is **IDENTICAL for every text draw**: Tx=333.6, Ty=866.0, Px=0.00156 (≈1/640), Pxw=-1.0, Py=-0.00278 (≈-1/360), Pyw=1.0. So it's a GLOBAL UI transform (a 1280×720 screen-ortho), NOT a per-item placement — it can't differentiate the text items.
- The text draws (gv=0xA011EEF0, 0xA01A7770, 0xA022FFF0, 0xA02B8870, 0xA03410F0 — ~6 buffers) have the **SAME local verts AND the same transform** ⇒ they're the SAME text item built into multiple buffers (double/triple buffering) + re-rendered by the directory exec. So the cont.117 "distortion" is the same text OVERLAPPING from N buffers, not a per-item position problem.
- Applying the transform: with the proj scale (Px/Py) → the text maps OFF-SCREEN (clip y=-1.404, since Ty=866 > the 720 proj height); with the translation + authoring scale (884/521.5) → on-screen (clip -0.6, 0.66) but the text-only-view experiments (skipping the obscuring flat panels/backdrops + the MENUTEST debug rects) broke the cont.117 visible state → blank.

**⇒ NEGATIVE — the per-draw transform is NOT the fix. REVERTED kernel.cpp + vulkan_render.cpp to the cont.117 state** (text visible-but-distorted, font atlas uploads, 8 colors). The binary is cont.117's; default boot UNREGRESSED. The legibility problem is the SAME text re-rendered from multiple buffers (overlap) + possibly the glyph layout — NOT a missing per-item transform.

**⭐NEXT (cont.119) — LEGIBLE TEXT, the right way: DEDUP the re-rendered text + RE the layout:** (a) the directory exec carves the SAME text item from ~6 buffers each frame → DEDUP (carve each unique text buffer once per frame — e.g. track seen gv's, or carve only the latest), removing the overlap; (b) with one clean copy, RE the cont.117 fixed-transform "fan" distortion — is it the glyph triangulation, a wrong vert count (numInd=252 vs the real glyph count), or the y-orientation? Dump the FULL glyph layout (all 252 verts' pos) for ONE text draw to see the intended layout; (c) the global reg-0x4000 transform IS the right screen-ortho (1280×720) — once the text reads, apply it consistently for game-accurate placement. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.118 = measurement + reverted experiments; binary is cont.117's, verified no-crash 688-line default boot).

———— cont.119 — ⭐ THE GLYPH LAYOUT IS PRISTINE: numInd=252 = 63 real glyphs forming a CLEAN 2-line text block. The cont.117 "fan/distortion" is the ~20× OVERLAP (same block re-drawn) + the wrong transform — NOT a layout/triangulation/count bug ————

**ONE MEASUREMENT (full glyph-layout RE) — no behavior change:** cont.118 left two open hypotheses for the cont.117 distortion: (a) the ~6 dup buffers overlapping, (b) the glyph layout itself (wrong vert count / triangulation / y-orientation). To settle it, replaced the cont.114 `[textvert]` dump (only the first 6 verts of 4 draws) with a FULL layout dump: a per-draw bbox (`[txtbbox]`: distinguish distinct menu lines vs dup buffers) + the COMPLETE per-glyph quad layout (`[glyphlayout]`/`[glyph NN]`: all 63 quads — 4 corners + uv bbox) for the first text draw. Gated on the `REX_SPRITECARVE` carve scope, independent of KTRACE (so it survives `REX_KTRACE=0`).

**METHOD FIX (the carve wasn't firing):** the per-frame-fence directory-exec (kernel.cpp:3741) is capped at 60 invocations = EARLY BOOT only, before the menu text loads — so `REX_DIREXEC` alone surfaced 0 text draws. The carve fires on the LOADED menu only through the **EXECSEGS path** (kernel.cpp:4288, runs the directory-exec under `tl_execsegs` at every swap). Correct combo: `REX_KTRACE=0 REX_EXECSEGS=3 REX_DIREXEC=1 REX_SPRITECARVE=1` (KTRACE off kills the 386k-line `KeGetCurrentProcessType` stub spam that was drowning the log + slowing the menu load).

**RESULT — 🎉 THE LAYOUT IS CLEAN; the distortion is OVERLAP, not layout:**
- **numInd=252 = exactly 63 glyphs** (4 verts each) — NO padding/garbage. The cont.118 worry "numInd=252 vs the real glyph count" is resolved: 252 IS 63 real glyphs.
- The 63 glyphs form a **clean 2-LINE text block** (authoring coords):
  - **line 1 = glyph00–32** (y∈[-0.5, 38.5], 33 glyphs, x advances 16.5→458.5)
  - **line 2 = glyph33–62** (y∈[37.5, 76.5], 30 glyphs, x advances 54.5→458.5)
  - 39px line height; x advances **monotonically** within each line (small 0–4px inter-glyph gaps = a proportional font). No degenerate/huge quads.
- **Quad winding is standard:** p0=TL, p1=TR, p2=BR, p3=BL ⇒ the cont.117 (0,1,2)+(0,2,3) triangulation is **CORRECT**.
- **ALL ~20 carved text draws are IDENTICAL** — same local verts, same bbox `(16.5,-0.5)-(458.5,76.5)` (442w × 77h), gv reused/incrementing (`0xA011EEF0` twice, then `0xA01A7750`, `0xA022FFD0`, … ~0x88820 apart). ⇒ the SAME single 2-line block is drawn ~20× per frame (consecutive ring copies replayed by the EXECSEGS+directory exec). This is the cont.117 "fan/band" — **20× OVERLAP, not a per-item position problem.**
- Saved the full dump to `varianta/tools/glyph_layout_c119.txt` (83 lines: the 20 bboxes + all 63 glyph quads) for cont.120.

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS (settled):** the cont.117 text distortion = (1) the **~20× overlap** of one pristine 2-line block (alpha-blended on top of itself → mush), + (2) the **wrong fixed transform** (cx=v/884−1, cy=v/521.5−1 — a placeholder that squashes/mis-places the block). It is NOT a layout, triangulation, vert-count, or y-orientation bug — the geometry the title authored is clean. **This means DEDUP alone (draw the block ONCE per frame) may already make the cont.117 text LEGIBLE** (just small / top-left), before any transform work.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** the change is purely additive inside the `REX_SPRITECARVE`-gated carve (default boot never sets it); verified — default boot reaches the loader (17 sections) → `XamLoaderLaunchTitle` with no crash/panic/abort (clean exit 137 timeout-kill; KTRACE-off boot = 40 structural lines). Diff: kernel.cpp only, +26/−7.

**⭐NEXT (cont.120) — DEDUP → legible text:** now that the layout is proven clean, the next CHANGE is the DEDUP: in the carve, draw each unique text block ONCE per frame (e.g. track the seen `gv` set per EXECSEGS frame, or skip a draw whose 63-vert content matches one already carved this frame), removing the ~20× overlap. Then capture (REX_RENDER+REX_MENUTEST+REX_MENUTEX+REX_TEXTGLYPH) and SEE whether the single clean 2-line block reads legibly with the existing 884/521.5 transform. If legible-but-mis-placed, cont.121 re-REs the real placement (the reg-0x4000 Tx/Ty puzzle — Ty=866 vs a 720 screen suggests the cont.118 matrix-element mapping is off; consider an empirical fit from the authoring bbox instead). Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH. Default boot UNREGRESSED (cont.119 = measurement only, additive gated dump; verified no-crash boot).

———— cont.120 — ⚠️ DEDUP IS A NEAR-NO-OP (overlap REFUTED): the text is 1 draw/FRAME, not ~20× within a frame. AND the capture reveals the real blocker — the submitted textured text DOESN'T render (only the 3 MENUTEST fallback rects show; 8 colors, matching cont.118's reverted state) ————

**ONE CHANGE (per-frame text-block dedup) + MEASUREMENT + CAPTURE:** cont.119 hypothesized the cont.117 distortion was the ~20× overlap of one block, so cont.120 implemented the dedup: in the carve (REX_TEXTGLYPH path), key each text block by an FNV-1a hash over sampled verts + numInd; carve each UNIQUE block once per frame, skip duplicates; reset the seen-set where tl_esTexVerts is cleared (the EXECSEGS per-frame boundary). Added a `[textdedup]` log (frame's total text draws → unique kept). Then measured (no renderer) + captured (renderer).

**RESULT 1 — 🔑 THE DEDUP IS A NEAR-NO-OP; cont.119's overlap hypothesis is REFUTED:** the `[textdedup]` log shows only **1 (rarely 2) text draw PER FRAME** — e.g. `frame: 1 text draws -> 1 unique kept (tl_esTexVerts=378 verts)` (378 = 63 glyphs × 6). The ~20 IDENTICAL blocks cont.119 saw were **across ~20 FRAMES** (each frame's fresh ring buffer at the next gv, ~0x88820 apart), NOT ~20 copies WITHIN one frame. Since tl_esTexVerts is cleared every frame, there was never any within-frame overlap to remove. ⇒ **OVERLAP IS NOT THE LEGIBILITY PROBLEM.** The dedup is correct + harmless (collapses the occasional 2→1) but does not change the visible result.

**RESULT 2 — ⚠️ THE REAL BLOCKER: the submitted textured text DOESN'T RENDER.** Captured the richest menu frame (REX_RENDER+REX_MENUTEST+REX_MENUTEX+REX_TEXTGLYPH + the carve chain → /tmp/varianta_menu.ppm, frame 467):
- the logs confirm the pipeline: `font atlas uploaded (256x256 FMT_8 @ guest 0x337D000)` + `textured geometry submitted (402 verts)` — atlas loaded (line 188) BEFORE the captures (line 299+), so g_bgLoaded=true at capture; all the line-976 draw gates (g_menutex, g_texPipe, g_texSet via UploadTexture, g_bgLoaded, texVerts=402, g_texGeoVB) are satisfied.
- BUT the captured image has only **8 distinct colors** = the clear (15,15,26) + the 3 MENUTEST fallback rects (subVerts=0 → the hardcoded red/green/blue validation quads, line 998) + their alpha blends. **ZERO white/grey text pixels** (8 flat colors ⇒ no anti-aliased glyphs anywhere). The textured text geometry is submitted but produces NO visible output.
- **This matches cont.118's NIGHT-LOG note for the reverted cont.117 state ("font atlas uploads, 8 colors")** — so the textured text has NOT reliably rendered since the cont.118 revert; the original cont.117 "17 colors / visible text band" was not reproduced. The geometry side (carve → submit) is fine; the RENDER side silently drops the text.

**⇒ DIAGNOSIS:** the legibility blocker is NOT overlap (refuted) and NOT the glyph layout (cont.119: pristine). It is that the **submitted textured-text draw (line 976, g_texPipe, 402 verts at clip top-left x[-0.98,-0.48] y[-1.0,-0.85]) is not rasterizing to visible pixels** despite all gates passing. Candidate causes for cont.121: (a) triangle winding vs g_texPipe back-face culling (the (0,1,2)+(0,2,3) CW-in-screen-space order may be culled); (b) the block sits at the extreme top edge (clip y starts at -1.001, just past the top) so it's mostly clipped/too thin to see; (c) an alpha-blend / FMT_8-coverage issue (the white-RGB + atlas-alpha texel could blend to invisible); (d) a capture/timing race on g_texGeom. **NEXT (cont.121): move the text to screen CENTER with a deliberate transform (rule out edge-clipping) AND check g_texPipe's cull mode + winding — a single decisive test of "does the textured text rasterize at all".** Saved the no-text capture to `varianta/tools/capture_c120_notext.png`.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** the dedup is purely additive inside the REX_TEXTGLYPH-gated carve + the REX_EXECSEGS-gated clear; the only always-compiled additions are two unused thread_locals. Verified — clean loader→XamLoaderLaunchTitle boot, 0 fatal markers (exit 137). Diff kernel.cpp only +29/−7.

———— cont.121 — 🎯 ROOT CAUSE FOUND (measured): the font atlas is **0/65536 non-zero bytes AT UPLOAD** — LoadFontAtlasOnce uploads the dynamic glyph cache too early (empty), so the text samples a fully-transparent texture → invisible. Positioning + cull/blend both ruled out first ————

**ONE INVESTIGATION (decisive "does the text rasterize?" test) — diagnostic-only:** cont.120 found the submitted textured text doesn't appear despite all draw gates passing. cont.121 isolated WHY in three steps, each ruling out a candidate:
1. **Free code inspection — cull/blend ruled out:** g_texPipe (CreateTexturedPipeline) has `cullMode = VK_CULL_MODE_NONE` (line 465) + standard alpha blend (SRC_ALPHA / ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA). So the (0,1,2)+(0,2,3) winding can't be back-face culled, and the blend is normal. Triangle winding/culling is NOT the blocker.
2. **REX_TEXTCENTER test — positioning ruled out:** added a gated transform that maps the text block to a LARGE CENTERED region (clip x≈[-0.65,0.61] y≈[-0.4,0.37], ~806×277px) instead of the 884/521.5 top-left placement (which sat at clip y from −1.001, just past the top edge). Captured: the image is **byte-identical to cont.120** — same 8 colors, same exact pixel counts, ZERO bright/white pixels. Centering changed NOTHING. ⇒ edge-clipping / too-small is NOT the blocker. (And since cull=NONE + the centered clip coords are well inside [−1,1], the geometry WOULD rasterize if drawn — so zero pixels ⟹ the draw samples a fully-transparent texture.)
3. **Atlas non-zero-byte measurement — 🎯 ROOT CAUSE:** added a count of non-zero atlas bytes inside LoadFontAtlasOnce at upload time. Result: **`font atlas uploaded — 0/65536 non-zero bytes at upload`.** The atlas is COMPLETELY EMPTY (all alpha-0) when uploaded.

**⇒ ROOT CAUSE (definitive, measured): the font atlas is uploaded TOO EARLY.** LoadFontAtlasOnce fires at the FIRST text submit (`g_texGeomVerts >= 3`, vulkan_render.cpp:934), but the atlas at 0xA337D000 is a DYNAMIC glyph cache (cont.116) that the title populates over time — at the first submit it's still all zeros. The `!g_bgLoaded` once-guard then prevents any re-upload. So g_tex holds an all-transparent 256×256 texture; every glyph quad samples alpha-0 → nothing rasterizes. cont.116's REX_FONTDUMP saw legible glyphs only because it dumped LATE (after 200 syncs), once the cache had populated. This explains EVERYTHING: the text-not-rendering, the 8-color capture, the position-independence (an empty texture is invisible at any position), and the match to cont.118's reverted "8 colors".

**⭐NEXT (cont.122) — THE FIX: re-upload the atlas once it's populated.** Change LoadFontAtlasOnce / its call site so the font texture reflects the LIVE atlas: either (a) re-upload every frame (the atlas is small, 256×256), or (b) defer the first upload until the atlas has non-zero content (skip while nz==0, retry next frame), or (c) re-upload every N frames / when content changes. Then capture (optionally with REX_TEXTCENTER to see it unmistakably) → the menu text should finally render as legible glyphs. Once it renders, drop REX_TEXTCENTER and tune the real placement (the cont.118 reg-0x4000 Tx/Ty re-RE / empirical fit from the cont.119 authoring bbox). Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** the REX_TEXTCENTER transform is gated behind its env flag in the REX_TEXTGLYPH carve; the nz count is inside LoadFontAtlasOnce (render-path only). Verified — clean loader→XamLoaderLaunchTitle boot, 0 fatal (exit 137). Diff: kernel.cpp +10/−2, vulkan_render.cpp +5/−2.

———— cont.122 — ⚠️ THE FIX (deferred upload) EXPOSED A DEEPER BLOCKER: the atlas address 0xA337D000 is EMPTY this whole run (nz=0/65536 across ~1800 frames) — the glyph cache is DYNAMICALLY allocated and cont.115's address was run-specific. The fix is correct for the timing but must discover the address dynamically ————

**ONE CHANGE (deferred atlas upload) + MEASUREMENT:** cont.121's root cause was "the atlas is uploaded too early (empty)". The fix: rewrote LoadFontAtlasOnce to DEFER the single upload until the dynamic cache has populated — require nz>0 AND nz stable across ≥3 frames (= done filling), with a ~240-frame fallback so it never waits forever. (UploadTexture is NOT re-entrant — it allocates a fresh image/view/sampler/descriptor-pool/set each call without freeing the old, so re-uploading every frame would leak; hence upload exactly once when ready.)

**RESULT — the deferred upload NEVER FIRED; 0x337D000 is EMPTY the entire run.** Added a throttled `[fontwait]` log of nz each 120 checks. Across the full ~1800-frame run it reads **`atlas nz=0/65536 @ g_base+0x337D000`** at EVERY check (#1, #121, #241, … #1801) — never non-zero. So the render thread sees the region 0x337D000 as all-zero from boot to the end. (Text WAS submitted — textdedup ×12, textured-geometry-submitted ×3 — so LoadFontAtlasOnce was called every frame; the upload was correctly withheld because the atlas was always empty.)

**⇒ THE DEEPER BLOCKER (measured): the hardcoded atlas address is WRONG for this run.** cont.115 found the font atlas at GPU 0xA337D000 in THAT run, but the glyph cache is DYNAMICALLY allocated, so its address VARIES per run — and this run's cache is NOT at 0x337D000 (which stays empty). The cont.117 hardcode `g_base + 0x337D000` therefore uploads empty memory regardless of timing. cont.121's "uploaded too early" was real but secondary; the primary blocker is the static address. (This also re-frames cont.121: nz=0 there wasn't just "too early" — 0x337D000 is simply not the atlas this run.)

**⇒ THE REAL FIX (cont.123): discover the atlas base DYNAMICALLY.** The prim-13 text draw BINDS its font atlas as a texture (cont.115: tex slot0, a type-2 fetch const, base read from the 0x4800 fetch-const region at the draw). The kernel carve already reads the draw's VERTEX fetch slot (gv); extend it to also read the TEXTURE fetch const's base, store it in a global (e.g. g_fontAtlasGuestAddr, atomic), and have LoadFontAtlasOnce upload from THAT live address (+ the cont.122 deferred-until-populated logic) instead of the hardcoded 0x337D000. Then capture (optionally REX_TEXTCENTER) → the menu text should finally render. Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** all changes are inside LoadFontAtlasOnce (render-path only; default boot never enters the renderer). Verified — clean loader→XamLoaderLaunchTitle boot, 0 fatal (exit 137). Diff: vulkan_render.cpp only, +16/−5.

———— cont.123 — ⚙️ DYNAMIC ATLAS DISCOVERY WORKS (address plumbed 0x337D000→0x337F000) but the bound atlas is EMPTY in shared memory all run (nz=0) — the glyph cache isn't populated at the bound address this run. The blocker moved from "wrong hardcoded address" to "the atlas data isn't there" ————

**ONE CHANGE (dynamic font-atlas address discovery) + MEASUREMENT:** cont.122 proved the hardcoded 0xA337D000 is run-specific. The fix: the kernel carve now reads the prim-13 text draw's BOUND texture fetch const (cont.115: type-2, 6 dwords/slot at 0x4800, base = d1[31:12]; the font atlas = 256×256 fmt=2 FMT_8) and publishes its phys offset to the renderer via a new `rex_render::SetFontAtlasAddr`; LoadFontAtlasOnce uploads from `g_base + g_fontAtlasPhys` instead of the hardcode (keeping the cont.122 deferred-until-populated logic). (Build note: SetFontAtlasAddr first landed inside rex_render's nested ANONYMOUS namespace → internal linkage → undefined-reference; fixed by defining it in the external part of rex_render, next to SubmitTexturedGeometry. Also had to `rm` the stale vulkan_render.cpp.o — ninja relinked without recompiling after the header change.)

**RESULT — discovery WORKS mechanically, but the bound address is EMPTY:** the `[fontwait]` log now reads **`@ g_base+0x337F000`** (not the 0x337D000 hardcode) — so the kernel found the live bound texture (0x337F000, +0x2000 from cont.115's address) and plumbed it through. BUT nz is STILL **`0/65536` at EVERY check (#1…#841)** across the whole run. So `g_base + 0x337F000` is empty from boot to end. Since the VIDEO path proves the render thread's g_base reads guest memory faithfully (video renders), 0x337F000 is **genuinely empty in shared guest memory** — not a memory-view mismatch. The font glyph atlas is NOT populated at the draw's bound address during this run.

**⇒ THE BLOCKER MOVED — from "wrong address" to "the data isn't there":** the prim-13 draw BINDS a 256×256 FMT_8 texture at 0x337F000 (the fetch const says so), but that memory is empty. cont.116 DID see a populated atlas (at 0xA337D000, a prior run) via REX_FONTDUMP — so the glyph cache CAN populate. The question is now WHERE/WHEN the glyph data lives this run: (a) is 0x337F000 the right slot, or did the "first 256×256 fmt=2" scan match a different (empty) texture than the draw's actual atlas? (b) is the atlas populated elsewhere in guest memory (a different address than the fetch const's base)? (c) does this REX_EXECSEGS+DIREXEC run config prevent the glyph population (cont.116 may have run more naturally), or is it a timing/menu-state issue?

**⭐NEXT (cont.124) — LOCATE the glyph data:** (1) REX_DRAWLOG the prim-13 text draw to dump ALL its bound textures (confirm 0x337F000 is the atlas slot, or find a better candidate — check tiled flag, prefer the draw's actual slot); (2) scan guest memory (kernel side, late) for the populated 256×256 FMT_8 region (significant non-zero run) to find where the glyphs actually are; (3) compare run configs — does the atlas populate under plain boot (cont.116-style) vs REX_EXECSEGS? Resolve whether the data is mis-addressed (fixable: point the upload at the real address) or genuinely never populated (deeper: the glyph render/decode isn't executing). Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** the discovery scan is in the REX_SPRITECARVE-gated carve (prim-13 only); SetFontAtlasAddr defaults to the old offset and is only called from the carve. Verified — clean loader→XamLoaderLaunchTitle boot, 0 fatal (exit 137). Diff: kernel.cpp +22, rex_render.h +6, vulkan_render.cpp +11/−2.

———— cont.124 — 🎯 PIVOTAL (measured): the font atlas is empty because variant A populates RGBA textures but NOT FMT_8 textures. EVERY fmt=0x2 (FMT_8) texture is empty (nz=0/64); EVERY fmt=0x6 (RGBA8) texture is full (nz=64/64). The menu text can't render because the glyph data literally isn't in guest memory — variant A doesn't rasterize the FMT_8 font atlas ————

**MEASUREMENT ONLY (existing tools — no code change; binary is cont.123's 4279faa):** cont.123 left the bound atlas (0x337F000) empty all run. cont.124 asks: is 0x337F000 the right slot, and is the glyph data anywhere?
1. **REX_DRAWLOG — 0x337F000 IS the right atlas:** every prim-13 text draw (init=0xFC008D numInd=252) binds `tex slot0 base=0x337F000 (gpu 0xA337F000) 256×256 fmt=2 tiled=0`. So the cont.123 dynamic discovery matched the CORRECT texture (not a wrong/empty slot). The other texture the menu binds is 0x2D98000 (1280×434 / 584×198 fmt=6 RGBA — the movie/background).
2. **REX_TEXBIND — the atlas is empty from the KERNEL side too:** the bound atlas dumps `DATA nz=0/64` (the kernel samples the first 64 dwords at 0xA337F000 — all zero). So it's not a render-thread view problem; the texture is genuinely empty in shared guest memory.
3. **🎯 THE PATTERN (the real finding) — FMT_8 empty, RGBA full:** across all bound textures:
   - **fmt=0x2 (FMT_8, single-channel/alpha) → DATA nz=0/64 (EMPTY):** 0xA2D78000, 0xA2FDB000, 0xA2FEB000, 0xA337F000 — every one empty.
   - **fmt=0x6 (FMT_8_8_8_8, RGBA) → DATA nz=64/64 (FULL):** 0xA2752000, 0xA2D98000, 0xA2E14000, 0xA2F27000, 0xA2FCF000, 0xA2FD3000, 0xA2FD7000 — every one populated.

**⇒ ROOT BLOCKER (measured): variant A populates RGBA textures but NOT FMT_8 textures.** The RGBA textures (movie frames, sprites) are filled by the video decoder / resource loader, which variant A's runtime DOES drive. The FMT_8 textures — including the menu's font glyph atlas — are ALL empty. So the menu text can't render because **the glyph bitmaps literally aren't in guest memory**: variant A never rasterizes/populates the FMT_8 font atlas. This is the true, deepest blocker — not the address (cont.123), not the upload timing (cont.122), not the layout (cont.119) or the pipeline (cont.121). The whole cont.117→123 render-side effort was plumbing toward an empty source.

**⇒ cont.116 DISCREPANCY (to resolve):** cont.116's REX_FONTDUMP read 0xA337D000 (FMT_8) and saw legible glyphs ("_This col / ntruedam / fpg"). If all FMT_8 textures are empty now, either (a) cont.116's run/config executed the font rasterization (timing/menu-state), (b) cont.116 read a region that transiently held data, or (c) something regressed the FMT_8 population since. Resolving this likely reveals HOW the atlas is supposed to populate.

**⭐NEXT (cont.125) — make variant A populate the FMT_8 font atlas:** RE how the FMT_8 atlas is filled in the title: is it (a) a GPU render-to-texture (glyph draws INTO the FMT_8 atlas) that variant A's interpreter skips; (b) an EDRAM→FMT_8 RESOLVE (the title renders glyphs to an EDRAM RT then resolves to the atlas — variant A's resolve/s_resultscan path may not execute it); or (c) a CPU font decode in guest code that isn't running? Trace the writes to 0xA337F000 (or any FMT_8 atlas) — find the command/segment that should populate it, and whether REX_EXECSEGS/DIREXEC executes it. Reproduce cont.116's populated-atlas config first (run plain + REX_FONTDUMP after N syncs) to confirm the atlas CAN populate, then diff against the carve config. This is the real wall now: the font glyphs must exist before any render-side work can show text.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** measurement-only (REX_DRAWLOG + REX_TEXBIND, both gated); no code change — binary unchanged from cont.123 (4279faa), default boot trivially unregressed.

———— cont.125 — 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH: the font atlas DOES populate with legible glyphs ("_This col / ntruedam / fpg") — in the REX_DIREXEC-only config. REX_EXECSEGS was BREAKING the population; the entire cont.122-124 "empty atlas" was an ARTIFACT of REX_EXECSEGS=3, not a variant-A limitation ————

**MEASUREMENT ONLY (existing flags — no code change; binary is cont.123's 4279faa):** cont.124 found all FMT_8 textures empty under the carve config (REX_EXECSEGS=3 + REX_DIREXEC). To resolve the cont.116 discrepancy (cont.116 SAW a populated atlas), reproduced cont.116's exact config: **REX_DIREXEC=1 + REX_FONTDUMP=1, NO REX_EXECSEGS.**

**RESULT — 🎉 THE ATLAS IS POPULATED:** `[fontdump] atlas @0xA337D000 probe dwords: FFC5D1BC FFC4D1BA …` (non-zero) → /tmp/varianta_font.ppm has **32391 non-zero bytes, 173 distinct gray values** (black background + white glyph cores + anti-aliased edges = real text, not a fill), **111/256 rows occupied**. Viewing it: **clearly legible glyphs "_This col / ntruedam / fpg"** — identical to cont.116. Saved to `varianta/tools/atlas_populated_direxec_c125.png`.

**⇒ 🎯 REX_EXECSEGS BREAKS THE FONT-ATLAS POPULATION.** The cont.122-124 "empty atlas / FMT_8-never-populated" conclusion was an ARTIFACT of `REX_EXECSEGS=3`: aggressively re-executing the device directory's [base,wptr] chunk every swap disrupts the title's font system so the glyph cache is never filled (and shifts the atlas address 0xA337D000 → 0xA337F000). With **REX_DIREXEC alone** (the per-frame-fence directory exec, line 3741), the title runs faithfully and **populates the atlas at 0xA337D000 with real glyphs**. So variant A CAN populate FMT_8 fonts — the earlier "deepest blocker" was self-inflicted by the EXECSEGS intervention. (Methodology echo of cont.95: an aggressive diagnostic intervention created a false negative.)

**⇒ THE PIECES NOW ALIGN (in the DIREXEC config):** the atlas is at **0xA337D000** (cont.115's original hardcode!), **populated** with legible glyphs, **discoverable** (cont.123 dynamic scan), **uploadable** (cont.122 deferred upload). The ONLY remaining gap is to carve+submit the menu text in this config — WITHOUT the EXECSEGS path that breaks population.

**⭐NEXT (cont.126) — render the text WITHOUT REX_EXECSEGS:** the carve+submit currently lives in the EXECSEGS path (kernel.cpp 4255-4351: clears tl_esTexVerts, execs the directory at 4288, submits at 4348/4351). But REX_EXECSEGS breaks the atlas. The per-frame-fence REX_DIREXEC (line 3741) executes the directory faithfully (atlas stays populated) but is capped at 60 invocations (early boot, before the menu loads) and does NOT submit. Plan: (a) UNCAP / extend the line-3741 direxec so it executes the directory LATE (carving the loaded menu's prim-13 text + prim-5 panels) without EXECSEGS; (b) wire the carve→submit (move/replicate the tl_esTexVerts clear + SubmitTexturedGeometry/SubmitMenuGeometry into the DIREXEC path, or gate the EXECSEGS submit block to run under DIREXEC); (c) run with REX_RENDER+REX_MENUTEST+REX_MENUTEX+REX_TEXTGLYPH + REX_DIREXEC (no EXECSEGS) → the atlas populates (0xA337D000) + the text carves + uploads + draws → LEGIBLE menu text at last. Verify the atlas stays populated ([fontwait] nz>0) under the new path. Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** measurement-only (REX_DIREXEC + REX_FONTDUMP, both gated); no code change — binary unchanged from cont.123 (4279faa).

———— cont.126 — ⚠️ NOCHUNK NEGATIVE: skipping the [base,wptr] chunk re-exec did NOT restore the atlas population. The EXECSEGS disruptor is NOT the chunk re-exec — it's the broader continuous directory re-execution (the atlas address itself differs: 0x337F000 under EXECSEGS vs 0xA337D000 under faithful DIREXEC-only) ————

**ONE CHANGE (REX_NOCHUNK gate) + MEASUREMENT:** cont.125 proved REX_EXECSEGS breaks the atlas population while REX_DIREXEC-only leaves it populated. Hypothesis: the EXECSEGS path's [base,wptr] CHUNK re-exec (kernel.cpp 4320-4330) — which re-runs the title's current command stream every swap — is the disruptor, while the directory exec (4335) is the same faithful logic as the working DIREXEC. Added REX_NOCHUNK to skip ONLY the chunk re-exec (keeping the directory carve + clear + submit).

**RESULT — NEGATIVE: the atlas is STILL empty.** Ran REX_RENDER+REX_MENUTEST+REX_MENUTEX+REX_TEXTGLYPH+REX_EXECSEGS=3+REX_DIREXEC+REX_NOCHUNK+REX_SPRITECARVE: `[fontwait]` reads `atlas nz=0/65536 @ g_base+0x337F000` at every check (#1…#841) — still empty, still at 0x337F000 (the EXECSEGS-style address, NOT the faithful 0xA337D000). The text still carves (`textured geometry submitted (378 verts)`) but no `font atlas uploaded` (the deferred upload correctly withholds — atlas empty). So skipping the chunk re-exec changed nothing for the atlas.

**⇒ THE DISRUPTOR IS NOT THE CHUNK RE-EXEC.** Two clues narrow it: (1) NOCHUNK (which removed the chunk re-exec) left the atlas empty AND at 0x337F000 — so the chunk re-exec wasn't causing either the emptiness or the address shift; (2) the atlas ADDRESS differs between configs — 0x337F000 under EXECSEGS(+NOCHUNK) vs 0xA337D000 under faithful DIREXEC-only — meaning EXECSEGS alters the title's MEMORY ALLOCATION (the title takes a different code path). The remaining suspect is the **continuous, every-swap directory re-execution** (4335) under tl_execsegs at swap time: re-running the directory's GPU state/draws/EVENT_WRITEs/resolves every swap fundamentally alters the title's execution, so it allocates the atlas elsewhere and never populates it. The DIREXEC-only path (3741) is capped at 60 (early boot) — it intervenes briefly then STOPS, letting the title run free and populate the atlas late.

**⭐NEXT (cont.127) — carve ONCE, then stop (let the title populate the atlas):** the tension is that the menu loads LATE (needs a late directory exec to carve) but continuous late execution disrupts the atlas. Resolution: exec the directory only until the menu text is CARVED (detect the prim-13 draws), CACHE the carved tl_esTexVerts/tl_esVerts, set a "carved" latch, then STOP re-executing — so the title runs free afterward and populates the atlas, while the cached geometry is submitted every frame and the deferred upload grabs the populated atlas. Test variants: (a) cap the EXECSEGS directory exec at a late-but-bounded count; (b) a one-shot carve latch (carve when prim-13 first seen, then disable further directory exec); (c) verify [fontwait] nz>0 after the latch. If the brief carve still disrupts, fall back to carving the geometry from the directory WITHOUT full ExecutePM4 side effects (process SET_CONSTANT + DRAW_INDX-carve only, skip EVENT_WRITE/resolve). Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** REX_NOCHUNK is gated inside the REX_EXECSEGS block (default boot enters neither). Verified — clean loader→XamLoaderLaunchTitle boot, 0 fatal (exit 137). Diff: kernel.cpp +8/−1.

———— cont.127 — 🎉 THE CARVE-ONCE LATCH SOLVES THE ATLAS POPULATION: after latching (carve once, stop re-executing), the title runs free and POPULATES the atlas at 0xA337D000 (legible glyphs, 32391 non-zero). The only remaining gap: the carve reads a STALE address (0x337F000) while the LIVE populated atlas is 0xA337D000 ————

**ONE CHANGE (REX_CARVEONCE one-shot latch) + MEASUREMENT:** cont.126 isolated the disruptor to the CONTINUOUS every-swap directory re-execution. Fix: in the EXECSEGS path, exec the directory only until the menu text is CARVED, cache the geometry, set a one-shot latch, then on every later swap SKIP the re-exec and replay the cache — so the title runs free to populate the atlas. Paired with `REX_EXECSEGS=250` so the single carve fires LATE (after the atlas has had time to populate).

**RESULT — 🎉 THE LATCH WORKS + THE ATLAS POPULATES:**
- `[carveonce] LATCHED at swap 250: cached 378 tex + 48 menu verts; directory re-exec now disabled` — the one-shot fired; subsequent swaps replay the cache.
- After the latch, the title runs free and **populates the atlas at 0xA337D000**: `REX_FONTDUMP` in this exact config reads `@0xA337D000 probe dwords FFC5D1BC FFC4D1BA…` → **32391/196608 non-zero, legible glyphs** ("_This col / ntruedam / fpg"). So the carve-once latch SOLVED the cont.125/126 atlas-population blocker — stopping the continuous re-exec lets the font system fill the atlas.

**⇒ THE LAST GAP — a STALE carve address:** the carve's dynamic discovery (cont.123) reads the prim-13 draw's bound texture from the DIRECTORY = **0x337F000**, which stays EMPTY (`[fontwait] nz=0/65536` all run). But the LIVE populated atlas is at **0xA337D000** (the cont.115 ORIGINAL hardcode). So the directory's recorded prim-13 draw references a stale/back-buffer atlas (0x337F000) while the title's font system populates the front atlas (0xA337D000). The deferred upload (cont.122), waiting on the empty 0x337F000, never fires → no text yet. This re-frames cont.123: the "dynamic address" 0x337F000 was the STALE directory address; in the faithful (latched) config the atlas is consistently at 0xA337D000. (It also re-frames cont.124: "all FMT_8 empty" sampled the BOUND/stale 0x337F000, never the live 0xA337D000.)

**⭐NEXT (cont.128) — point the upload at the POPULATED atlas → render the text:** make LoadFontAtlasOnce upload from the atlas that actually has data: among the candidates {the carve's g_fontAtlasPhys, the 0x337D000 hardcode}, pick the one with nz>0 (reuse the existing nz scan + the deferred-until-populated logic). With REX_CARVEONCE the title fills 0xA337D000; the upload grabs it; the cached text draws sample it → LEGIBLE menu text at last. Verify: `[fontwait]`/upload shows nz>0 and the capture shows readable letters. If the glyph UVs (carved against the 0x337F000 layout) don't match 0xA337D000's content, RE whether the two atlases share a layout (likely — same menu font). Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** REX_CARVEONCE is gated inside the REX_EXECSEGS block (default boot enters neither). Verified — clean loader→XamLoaderLaunchTitle boot, 0 fatal (exit 137). Diff: kernel.cpp +21/−2.

———— cont.128 — 🎉 THE FONT ATLAS NOW UPLOADS (10797/65536 non-zero @ 0xA337D000): the real bug was the render thread reading the WRONG HOST OFFSET (masked phys g_base+0x337D000 vs the FULL GPU aperture g_base+0xA337D000) — wrong since cont.117. BUT the text still doesn't render (the textured DRAW produces no pixels — a separate issue) ————

**ONE CHANGE (fix the atlas-source address) + MEASUREMENT:** cont.127 found the live atlas populated at 0xA337D000 (via GLD32) while the render thread's [fontwait] (g_base + masked offset) read empty. The fix: (a) LoadFontAtlasOnce picks the populated candidate among {the carve's address, 0x337D000}; (b) 🎯 THE BUG — `GLD32(a)` reads `g_base + a` DIRECTLY (kernel.cpp:562), and the 0xA0000000 GPU aperture is mapped into g_base at the FULL address (kernel.cpp:861, "Xbox physical-address window all lazily mmap'd"). So the atlas is at `g_base + 0xA337D000`, NOT `g_base + 0x337D000` (the masked phys — a different, empty host page). The cont.117 hardcode `g_base + 0x337D000` (and cont.122/123's [fontwait]) read the empty page. Use the FULL aperture addresses `0xA0000000 | offset`.

**RESULT — 🎉 THE ATLAS UPLOADS:** `[fontwait] best atlas nz=10797/65536 @ g_base+0xA337D000` + **`[render] font atlas uploaded (256x256 FMT_8 @ guest 0xA337D000) — 10797/65536 non-zero bytes`**. The cont.117→127 atlas-source bug is FIXED — the upload now reads the real glyphs. This also re-frames the whole cont.122-127 chain: the atlas was readable at `g_base + 0xA337D000` ALL ALONG; the render thread just read the wrong host offset (masked vs full). So cont.122-127's "empty atlas" [fontwait] measurements were confounded by the offset — the cont.125 "EXECSEGS breaks population" / cont.127 "carve-once fixes it" conclusions may be partly artifacts of the masked-offset read (to be untangled in cont.129: does the atlas upload WITHOUT REX_CARVEONCE now?).

**⇒ BUT THE TEXT STILL DOESN'T RENDER (a separate, deeper draw issue):** with the atlas uploaded, the capture is STILL 8 colors / 0 bright pixels — even with REX_TEXTCENTER (the text mapped to a large central region). The text geometry is submitted (3 textured submissions, 426 verts) and is NOT obscured by the MENUTEST fallback rects (the top-left band sits at clip y[-1.0,-0.85], above the rects; the centered version extends outside them) — yet zero text pixels. So the textured DRAW (vulkan_render.cpp:976, g_texPipe) is not producing visible output, independent of the (now-correct) atlas. This is the same mystery as cont.121, now confirmed NOT to be the atlas.

**⭐NEXT (cont.129) — diagnose the textured text DRAW:** (a) add a one-shot log at the draw (line 976) — does it fire? what are texVerts / g_bgLoaded / g_texSet at the captured (richest) frame? (b) check the capture timing — the "richest frame" may be captured before g_bgLoaded or with a stale texVerts; force REX_RENDER_SHOT at a late frame; (c) disable the 3 MENUTEST fallback rects (line 998) to rule out any draw-order/overdraw; (d) verify the vertex format (the textured pipeline's stride vs the carve's 4-floats/vert) + that g_texGeoVB holds the cached data; (e) ALSO test: does the atlas upload without REX_CARVEONCE (untangle the offset-vs-config confound). The atlas is now correct, so this is the last render-side gap before legible text. Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** the change is in LoadFontAtlasOnce (render-path only; default boot never enters the renderer). Verified — clean loader→XamLoaderLaunchTitle boot, 0 fatal (exit 137). Diff: vulkan_render.cpp +21/−12.

———— cont.129 — 🎉🎉🎉 THE MENU TEXT RENDERS WITH LEGIBLE FONT GLYPHS ("_This col[lection]…"). The cont.128 "no text" was a CAPTURE-TIMING artifact: the richest-frame heuristic captured BEFORE the deferred atlas upload completed. A late forced capture shows the full textured text. THE A↔B TEXT WALL IS CRACKED ————

**MEASUREMENT ONLY (REX_RENDER_SHOT — no code change; binary is cont.128's 2a4fb75):** cont.128 fixed the atlas upload (full GPU-aperture address) but the capture still showed no text. Hypothesis: the "richest frame" capture (vulkan_render.cpp:1016-1018, captures the first frame at max submitted verts) fires when texVerts first hits 426 — at the carve-once latch (swap 250) — but the atlas upload is DEFERRED ~4 frames for stability (cont.122), so the captured frame PRE-DATES `g_bgLoaded`, and no later frame is "richer" to re-capture. Forced a late capture with `REX_RENDER_SHOT=600`.

**RESULT — 🎉 THE TEXT RENDERS:** the log order confirms it — `captured frame 317` (richest, pre-upload) → `font atlas uploaded … 10797/65536 non-zero` → `captured frame 600` (forced, post-upload). The frame-600 capture jumps from **8 → 1495 distinct colors**, **11491 pure-white (255,255,255) pixels + 115719 bright pixels** = anti-aliased glyphs. Viewing it: **clearly LEGIBLE menu text — "_This col" and the rest of the string** — the SAME glyphs as the atlas dump, now rendered through the textured pipeline (g_texPipe sampling the uploaded font atlas). Sent the image to the user. (The red/green/blue MENUTEST validation rects overlap on top — drawn after the text, alpha-blended.)

**⇒ THE ENTIRE cont.119→129 CHAIN PAYS OFF — variant A's menu text renders:** glyph layout (cont.119) → carve geometry+UVs → carve-once latch so the title populates the atlas (cont.127) → atlas upload from the full GPU-aperture address (cont.128) → textured draw → legible letters (cont.129). The "text doesn't render" problem is SOLVED; what remains is polish, not a wall.

**⭐NEXT (cont.130) — clean composited render + game-accurate positions:** (a) FIX THE CAPTURE TIMING properly — capture after `g_bgLoaded` (e.g. re-capture when the atlas first uploads, or capture the richest frame seen AFTER g_bgLoaded) so the default capture (and any future on-screen render) shows the text without REX_RENDER_SHOT; (b) DISABLE the 3 MENUTEST fallback rects (vulkan_render.cpp:998, the subVerts==0 branch) when REX_TEXTGLYPH so they don't obscure the text; (c) drop REX_TEXTCENTER and place the text at GAME-ACCURATE positions — the carved verts already carry the title's authoring coords (cont.119 bbox (16.5,-0.5)-(458.5,76.5)); tune the authoring→clip transform (the cont.118 reg-0x4000 screen-ortho, or an empirical fit) so the 2-line block lands where the title intends; (d) then the prim-5 panels (RGBA, populated) for the full composited menu. Also (housekeeping): untangle whether REX_CARVEONCE is still needed now that the atlas-offset bug is fixed (cont.128). Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** measurement-only (REX_RENDER_SHOT, gated); no code change — binary unchanged from cont.128 (2a4fb75).

———— cont.130 — 🎉 CLEAN LEGIBLE MENU TEXT BY DEFAULT: white font glyphs, NO debug rects, captured automatically (no REX_RENDER_SHOT). Two render tweaks: skip the obscuring MENUTEST rects + capture only after the atlas uploads ————

**ONE CHANGE (render cleanup — 2 coupled tweaks) + CAPTURE:** cont.129 proved the text renders but (a) the richest-frame capture fired before the deferred atlas upload (needed REX_RENDER_SHOT), and (b) the 3 MENUTEST validation rects alpha-blended OVER the text. Both fixed in PresentOnce:
- **Skip the MENUTEST rects under REX_TEXTGLYPH** (vulkan_render.cpp:1023, the subVerts==0 branch) — they obscured the text.
- **Gate the richest-frame capture on `g_bgLoaded`** in REX_TEXTGLYPH mode (`atlasReady = !REX_TEXTGLYPH || g_bgLoaded`) — so the captured frame is POST-upload and shows the text, without forcing REX_RENDER_SHOT.

**RESULT — 🎉 CLEAN TEXT, captured by default:** ran the full config WITHOUT REX_RENDER_SHOT and WITHOUT REX_TEXTCENTER — `captured frame 323` (after `font atlas uploaded … 10797/65536`) → **471 distinct colors, 145748 bright + 19428 pure-white pixels**. Viewing it: **clean white menu-font text on the dark clear — "□ _This col" / "ntruedam" / "fpg"** — the menu's real glyph content, legible, NO debug rects obscuring it. Sent the clean image to the user. (The layout mirrors the atlas glyph rows — the placeholder transform cx=v/884−1, cy=v/521.5−1 spreads the glyphs; cont.131 applies the game-accurate transform.)

**⇒ THE MENU TEXT RENDERS CLEANLY end-to-end** — the textured-text path (carve → atlas populate → full-aperture upload → textured draw → capture) is fully working and visible by default. Remaining is positional polish + the panels.

**⭐NEXT (cont.131) — GAME-ACCURATE TEXT POSITIONS:** the carve's authoring→clip transform (kernel.cpp:1893, cx=v/884−1, cy=v/521.5−1) is a placeholder that spreads the glyphs across the screen / mirrors the atlas rows. Apply the title's REAL transform so the 2-line text block (cont.119 bbox (16.5,-0.5)-(458.5,76.5)) lands where the menu intends: use the cont.118 reg-0x4000 screen-ortho (Tx=333.6, Ty=866, Px=1/640, Py=-1/360) — re-examine whether the cont.118 "off-screen" result was itself confounded by the (now-fixed) atlas/capture issues — OR empirically fit authoring→clip to a known menu-text screen rect. Then RE whether the rendered glyph LAYOUT (3 atlas-like rows vs the intended sentence) is the real menu layout or an artifact of the placeholder transform. After that: the prim-5 panels (RGBA, populated) for the full composited menu. Housekeeping: test dropping REX_CARVEONCE / REX_EXECSEGS now the atlas-offset bug is fixed. Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** both tweaks are gated (REX_TEXTGLYPH / render-path only; default boot never enters PresentOnce). Verified — clean loader→XamLoaderLaunchTitle boot, 0 fatal (exit 137). Diff: vulkan_render.cpp +6/−2.

———— cont.131 — ⚠️ HONEST CORRECTION of cont.129/130: the big legible "_This col…" text is a FULL-SCREEN atlas-like display, NOT the positioned menu text. The actual carved menu block (cont.119 2-line) renders as a TINY THIN STRIP at the top (the cx/cy placeholder). Measured the real clip positions ————

**MEASUREMENT (clip-position instrumentation — one-shot logs, no behavior change):** before applying a "game-accurate transform", verified what the cont.130 render actually shows. The image has a thin noisy strip at the very top + big 3-row "_This col / ntruedam / fpg" filling the upper half — and the 3-row content/order mirrors the ATLAS (cont.116), not a 63-glyph sentence. Added two dumps: `[clippos]` (the carve's actual clip pos for glyph0) + a clip-bbox dump in SubmitTexturedGeometry (what the render receives).

**RESULT — the celebrated "text" is a full-screen atlas display:**
- `[clippos] glyph0 clip TL(-0.981,-1.001) BR(-0.959,-0.926)` — the carved menu block's first glyph is a TINY ~14×27px quad at the top-left, exactly the cx/cy thin-band placement (cont.119 predicted clip y[-1.0,-0.85]). So the carved menu-text geometry = the **thin noisy strip at the top**.
- `[render] textured geometry submitted (426 verts) clip-bbox=(-1.001,-1.001)-(0.999,0.999)` — the SUBMITTED geometry spans the **FULL clip range** (top-left to bottom-right). So tl_esTexVerts = the 63-glyph menu block (thin top strip, 378 verts) **PLUS extra geometry (~48 verts) spanning the whole screen**. That full-screen-spanning textured geometry — sampling the atlas — is the **big 3-row "_This col…" display** that dominates the cont.129/130 images.

**⇒ CORRECTION:** cont.129/130's "the menu text renders legibly" was the **full-screen atlas-like display quad(s)**, NOT the menu's positioned text. The real menu text (the cont.119 2-line block) renders as the tiny thin top strip because the carve still uses the **placeholder transform** (cx=v/884−1, cy=v/521.5−1) — and the extra full-screen geometry happens to show the atlas big. The font-atlas/upload/textured-draw plumbing is genuinely working (the glyphs ARE sampled + rendered), but the POSITIONED menu text is not yet at game-accurate positions or a readable size.

**⭐NEXT (cont.132) — separate the menu text from the full-screen geometry + transform it:** (a) per-draw dump the carved prim-13 blocks (the cont.119 63-glyph menu block vs the ~8-quad full-screen geometry) — identify what the full-screen-spanning verts are (a legit atlas/background draw? a second text item? an over-large quad from a bad stride/numInd?) and whether to keep or filter them; (b) apply the title's REAL authoring→clip transform to the menu block (the cont.118 reg-0x4000 screen-ortho — now re-derivable in the faithful carve-once config, and no longer confounded by the cont.128 atlas-offset / cont.129 capture bugs) so the 2-line block lands at game-accurate position+size; (c) capture → the menu text legible AT ITS REAL PLACE. Gate behind REX_TEXTGLYPH.

**Default boot UNREGRESSED:** instrumentation-only (one-shot [clippos] in the REX_SPRITECARVE carve + clip-bbox in SubmitTexturedGeometry; render behavior unchanged from cont.130). Verified — clean loader→XamLoaderLaunchTitle boot, 0 fatal (exit 137). Diff: kernel.cpp +2, vulkan_render.cpp +6/−1.
